# [Huboard!](http://huboard.com)

I&#8217;ve been working on a big redesign of [huboard](https://github.com/rauhryan/huboard) since around September or so. I&#8217;m finally ready to reveal all of that hard work. So what better way to show off all the new features than animated gifs, right?

## Overall &#8220;cleaner&#8221; design and improved performance

## Three state multi faceted filtering

Clicking a filter once will dim out issues that don&#8217;t match, click again and they disappear. Filters can be mixed and matched to help you narrow down exactly what you need to work on.

## Super fast text search on the title

## Drag to assign issues

Quickly assign issues by dragging your avatar onto the card

## Drag cards between milestones

I built a whole new board to help you manage your backlog. Everything works exactly the same except the columns are now milestones.

## Prioritize milestones

![milestone reorder](http://f.cl.ly/items/0A3f2C2K0B263N2p3I3L/milestone_reorder.gif)

Ordering milestones using drag and drop makes it quick and easy to prioritize your backlog.

That&#8217;s it. I hope y&#8217;all enjoy the new features
