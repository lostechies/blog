# Huboard! 

I&#8217;ve been working one a few new features in my side project [huboard](http://huboard.com)
  
and they are pretty awesome.

Since the start I&#8217;ve always prioritized features by what **adds** the most value to github issues. That means features github already provides are much lower in priority, which is why you still can&#8217;t add issues from huboard. Eventually I will add it, but github already provides that functionality or you could use other tools `gem install ghi`. Even more importantly huboard is [open source](https://github.com/rauhryan/huboard), I would love it if someone would fork it and add those features.

So what&#8217;s new in huboard that github doesn&#8217;t provide?

### Milestone ordering 

Huboard provides the ability to prioritize your milestones using a more macro oriented manager pants view.

From here you can happily drag your milestones into the desired order

### Issue ordering 

Huboard provides the same ordering ability for issues.

Notice how issue #23 is between #31 and #35

### Aggregate issues from multiple repositories 

Huboard can now aggregate issues from multiple repositories into one singular overview of all your repositories

Simple as adding a label to your repo name  `Link <=> rauhryan/ghee`

Huboard shows issues from both repositories!

Github issues just got a little more awesome!
