I&#8217;m now joining Los Techies! Â For anyone who may have been reading my old blog over at [github](http://rauhryan.github.com) I won&#8217;t be blogging there anymore. I will soon port over the few posts I have over there. Soon I&#8217;m going to re-purpose my github site into a current projects page.

My name is Ryan Rauh and I like shiny stuff. If its new and I&#8217;ve seen it mentioned on Twitter more than twice chances are I&#8217;m going to go read about it or use it. I&#8217;m not super opinionated so I&#8217;m not likely to throw up exhaustive rant posts or tell you &#8220;you&#8217;re doing it wrong&#8221; instead I&#8217;m going to blog about what \*I\* think is cool and interesting.

I&#8217;m not easily trolled&#8230; So don&#8217;t even try ðŸ˜‰

I also \*love\* memes, so expect lots of memes and other silly things in my posts.

I&#8217;ve got a new fire in my belly to blog and I&#8217;ve got a great backlog going so I hope it doesn&#8217;t fade.

Thanks again to Los Techies for inviting me. I&#8217;m kinda awesome so hit me up on twitter @rauhr or in the comments below.

Laters,

Herp Derp
