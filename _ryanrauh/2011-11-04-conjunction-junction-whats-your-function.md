A came across the [video](http://usergroup.tv/videos/conjunction-junction-what-s-your-function-javascript) from my JavaScript talk at Austin Code Camp. I just watched it and I have to say it&#8217;s really weird hearing myself present. I am probably way too harsh on myself because I noticed a lot of mistakes I made when I was trying to do my live coding example. I really wish it was a recording of this same talk I did at Pablo&#8217;s Fiesta because the crowd was really really interactive and we ended going through a really good overloading functions example in JavaScript.

Never the less it&#8217;s out there and I&#8217;ve been told that it was a pretty good talk. Feel free to leave me some feedback anything I can do to make the talk better or more informative is greatly appreciated.
