As part of the install of ReSharper 3.0 install into Visual Studio 2008, I "accidentally" selected the Visual Studio keymappings to try it out. 

Yikes&#8230; what a mistake. I couldn&#8217;t stand it. It turned out to be some form of tough love.

I&#8217;m afraid that I&#8217;m too used to ReSharper and none of the Visual Studio keymappings are worth losing the ReSharper keymappings for (come on&#8230; no Ctrl-B?!?!). lol

So I changed it back:

As somebody on the team once said, Visual Studio is just a glorified form of Notepad without ReSharper. lol
