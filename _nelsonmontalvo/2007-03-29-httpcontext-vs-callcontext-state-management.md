[Here&#8217;s](http://forum.springframework.net/showthread.php?t=572) an interesting thread on using these various state management techniques across threads. It was brought up as an issue by a commenter on my NHibernate post on session management.

Although my examples so far appear to work because they are not being used in ASP.NET, they could potentially fail in that environment.

I will correct that example as soon as I get the opportunity to do so.
