The current Castle distribution seems to be linked to an older version of NHibernate. To use Castle with NHibernate 1.2, I had to work from the development trunk and not from the compiled distributions.   
  
So get the latest code from the Castle Subversion repository, compile it and link your Monorail project to those newly compiled libraries.  
  
Seems to work as of today&#8230; ðŸ™‚ Let me know if there are any alternatives. Thanks.
