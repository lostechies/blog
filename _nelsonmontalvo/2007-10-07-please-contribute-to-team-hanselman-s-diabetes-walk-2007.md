After&nbsp;watching <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>&nbsp;participate in several of the open spaces at Alt.Net this weekend, I have a different level of appreciation for Scott&#8217;s blog. He is not only prolific in his blogging and very knowledgeable, but &#8220;in the real world&#8221; he is well spoken,&nbsp;has a&nbsp;good sense of humor, and can hold his own&nbsp;in an open space format with good points, good&nbsp;questions and tactful responses.<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/fightdiabetes" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.hanselman.com/fightdiabetes/HanselmanBadge150.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px" align="right" border="0" /></a>

On his blog, Scott has a link to&nbsp;his <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/fightdiabetes" target="_blank">Team Hanselman&#8217;s Diabetes Walk 2007</a> page. On it, you can contribute. I would like to say that I contributed a small amount&nbsp;simply because Scott&#8217;s tips have been so dang useful over the past few years &#8211; his tools list alone has been priceless &#8211;&nbsp;but my dad is type II and it does suck. So please contribute what you can.

Thanks.
