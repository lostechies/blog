I just posted our invitation to the upcoming Fiesta.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re planning to attend I hope you&#8217;ll take a few minutes to prepare yourself so we all get the most out of the experience.&nbsp; 

If you have registered and you don&#8217;t plan on attending please let [John](/blogs/johnteague/contact.aspx "Contact John") know so we can make your ticket available to someone else &#8211; last time I checked we were almost sold-out.

For myself, I&#8217;m ready for the following:

  * I know why software quality and craftsmanship matters to me.&nbsp; I love programming so I want to do it well.&nbsp; I know how I define quality today but that definition is constantly refined and it gets better when I hear how other people define it.&nbsp; I have a family that needs me to make money and I want to continue doing that while doing something I love &#8211; creating software that works for users as well as possible.
  * I&#8217;m ready to take action.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spent the last several months working on my own personal improvement and it&#8217;s time for me to do more in my community.
  * I&#8217;m ready to hear (e.g. actually listen instead of mentally creating a rebuttal) opinions counter to my own.&nbsp; I&#8217;m ready to have my opinions challenged and to explain them without taking offense.

I hope you&#8217;re joining us.&nbsp; I know many of the people who will be there and I believe this will be a great weekend for all of us.
