I was thrilled to be invited to join the [Los Techies](http://feeds.feedburner.com/LosTechies) community.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been a fan-boy for some time and this is going to be fun.&nbsp; No code in this post, so I&#8217;ll be brief.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll mostly be focusing on how to apply some of the ideas the rest of the Los Techies gang blogs about in a less-than-ideal environment.&nbsp; So, if you have to deal with legacy applications, the buy + build mentality, or tight budgets stay tuned and we&#8217;ll look at some ideas together.

&nbsp;

Thanks again for inviting me!
