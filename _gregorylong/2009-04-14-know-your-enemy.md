Is it too late to make resolutions?&#160; Oh well, I’ll make one anyway.

I was listening to <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/eric/default.aspx" target="_blank">Eric’s</a> talk on getting a legacy system under control (e.g. under test) and he mentioned a saying I’ve heard so many times before but this time it hit me differently: “Don’t allow Best to be the enemy of Better.”&#160; I’ve had this beat into my head so much I usually don’t even consider the consequences of this statement as I code – it’s now a habit of thought.

But as I sat there last night I realized a lot of us in the programming community, myself included, often fail to apply this concept to ourselves (our career/skills/idea of ourselves).&#160; I believe this is part of the chasm Scott Bellware mentioned in a <a href="http://blog.scottbellware.com/2009/02/teaching-symbology-and-intellectual_01.html" target="_blank">post</a> about the gap between early adopters and mainstream developers.&#160; As early adopters build the excitement around the concepts and ideas they’ve discovered the rest of us may build an artificial ‘best’ out of their ‘better’.&#160; JP had a nice <a href="http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/FocusOnFunAndStepIntoFreedomInYourCareer.aspx" target="_blank">post</a> on this idea and I’ll borrow a piece:

> Lots of developers are unhappy because they feel they are losing a comparison game that they are unfortunately playing. They are swamped with all of the information coming at them by people on "blogs, twitter, facebook, screencasts, podcasts". They no sooner learn a new topic and then realize that one of the people they are following has already moved onto 15 new topics that they are now mastering. This can quickly become a very self defeating thing. Instead of savoring the journey, which is learning for them self, progressing at a pace that is comfortable to them, and one upping their personal abilities day after day; they become demoralized at the inability to "keep up".

By making someone else&#8217;s ‘better’ the basis for our ‘best’ we create a goal that may be both impossible to achieve and demoralizing.&#160; I can’t tell you if you’re allowing your idea of Best to be the enemy of your ability to be better but I can say you’re not alone.&#160; I can understand what many of the early adopters are saying but it takes me quite a bit longer to gain the ability to apply it.&#160; Gabriel had a nice <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/gabrielschenker/archive/2009/02/05/learning-and-understanding.aspx" target="_blank">post</a> on the process we all go through as we transition from our first exposure (level 1) to true understanding (level 6).&#160; I can get to Level 2 on his scale fairly quickly with most things but getting from there to Level 5 or 6 takes me a lot longer than most of my Los Techies colleagues.&#160; It took me many months to reach Level 5 with Lamda Expressions (ouch huh?).&#160; That’s totally fine because no matter the time it took I achieved my ‘Better’ and it was a fun journey because I didn’t stress about it.

So that’s my resolution – not to let anyone else’s ‘Better’ or ‘Best’ become the enemy of my Better.&#160; My Better is mine and I’m going to enjoy achieving it.&#160; Do you know your enemy?
