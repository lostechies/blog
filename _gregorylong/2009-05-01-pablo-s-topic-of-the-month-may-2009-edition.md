Have you ever read a blog post about TDD, Dependency Injection, or some other concept and thought, &ldquo;Sounds great . . . if you work in an ivory tower, but I have to work with [insert your code-base here].&rdquo;?&nbsp; Or maybe you really like the idea but you have no clue how to start without beginning the project over?&nbsp; If you answered yes then Pablo is going to make you smile because this month&rsquo;s topic is Refactoring &lsquo;Brownfield&rsquo; Projects.&nbsp; Wikipedia has a fairly complete definition of Brownfield ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield\_(software\_development)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)")) but for our purposes you can consider any project that must use or take into consideration &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; code a Brownfield project.&nbsp; What is &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; code?&nbsp; Again, for Pablo this means any code that isn&rsquo;t under test &ndash; including that lovely bit of code I just wrote . . . hmmm, I can&rsquo;t wait to see what Pablo has this month.
