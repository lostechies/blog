<span style="font-size: large">Pablo&#8217;s Fiesta Invitation</span>

How
  
do you define, improve, and celebrate Software Quality and Craftsmanship
  
in yourself, your organization, and your community? Los Techies is
  
searching for answers to these questions and we&#8217;ve invited you to join
  
us to explore together.

We&#8217;re excited about this
  
conference and the conversations we hope will take place . For those
  
conversations to live up to our expectations and yours you must come
  
prepared to:

_**Engage in open conversations**_. If you
  
have an idea, know the reasons for that idea and be prepared to discuss
  
them without taking offense. If you disagree with an idea, be prepared
  
to criticize the idea, not the person.

_**Know why Software Quality and Craftsmanship matters to you**_.
  
We know why it matters to us &#8211; we&#8217;re inviting you to hear why it
  
matters to you. If you don&#8217;t know why, take some time to explore the
  
answers before you attend.   
_**  
Provide actionable ideas and take action after the conference is over.**_ If all we do is discuss a few ideas, solidify viewpoints, and bolster our egos this conference won&#8217;t
  
have done much. We want to leave the Fiesta energized to make our profession better fit our dreams.

If you you walk out of the Fiesta muttering to yourself we never talked about the really important issues you cared
  
about, please notice the person responsible for that is you.

It&#8217;s
  
time to get to work. What are the issues and opportunities for Software
  
Quality and Craftsmanship you care about? What are your ideas,
  
questions, and desires for resolution and future directions in Software
  
Quality and Craftsmanship? How do we make those ideas happen now &#8211; all
  
the way to the level of implementation?
