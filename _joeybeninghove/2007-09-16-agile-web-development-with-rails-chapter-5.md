What!&nbsp; You tease me with code in Chapter 4 and now there is none in this chapter?!?&nbsp; Oh wait, I guess we should at least figure out _what_ we want to build moving forward.&nbsp; ðŸ™‚

#### Chapter 5

Well this chapter is all about doing some very high level use cases, page flows and a&nbsp;quick&nbsp;data diagram.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just scribbled on a piece of paper, so it&#8217;s nowhere near as scary as a &#8220;dysfunctional requirement&#8221; or UML diagram.&nbsp; It&#8217;s your basic e-commerce application.&nbsp; Which is fitting since I&#8217;m actually right in the&nbsp;middle of an e-commerce project at my &#8220;day job&#8221; which I&#8217;m building with MonoRail.&nbsp; 

<side_note>

_Speaking of MonoRail, was chatting with a friend earlier and he mentioned that it would be nice to see some comparisons of MonoRail and RoR during this whole process.&nbsp; I figured some of those comparisons would naturally make there way as I move through the book.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ll try and make a more concerted effort to point out the important differences as I come across them._

</side_note>

So that&#8217;s really all that&#8217;s in this chapter.&nbsp; Dave does point out how RoR fits in perfectly with agile because of the ability to make such quick on-the-fly type of changes and the customers can be involved more often.

Alright, next I get to write some code again!
