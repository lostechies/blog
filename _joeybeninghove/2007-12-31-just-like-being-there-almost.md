Unfortunately I haven&#8217;t been able to make it to any of the jazzy conferences in 2007.&nbsp; There are a few that I would&#8217;ve really liked to have attended; [altnetconf](http://www.altnetconf.com/home), [DevTeach](http://www.devteach.com/), [RailsConf](http://railsconf.org) and [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org/) to name a few.&nbsp; Luckily, you can find quite a bit of the content from some of these kinds of conferences online.&nbsp; Just tonight I watched a really good presentation from RubyConf 2007, [Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec](http://rubyconf2007.confreaks.com/d3t1p2_rspec.html).&nbsp; There are many more I&#8217;d like to [watch from RubyConf](http://rubyconf2007.confreaks.com/) if I can find the time.&nbsp; And of course the [awesome MVC video from ScottGu](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottGuMVCPresentationAndScottHaScreencastFromALTNETConference.aspx) himself at altnetconf is a must see.

So for those of you, like me, who for whatever reason can&#8217;t make it to some of these conferences, here are a few good places to start:

  * [Confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com/) (these guys do an awesome job, giving you widescreen videos with the slides/code side by side with the presenter) 
      * [ScribeMedia](http://www.scribemedia.org/category/web-20/) (where I originally watched the RailsConf 2006 stuff) 
          * [Parleys](http://www.parleys.com/display/PARLEYS/Home) (saw an awesome DDD video here once) 
              * [Google Videos](http://video.google.com/) (of course) </ul> 
            I&#8217;m sure there are many more, so leave a comment with some more good post-conference resources if you know of any.
            
            (Hopefully my ability to join in the conference goodness will be a bit better in the coming year)
