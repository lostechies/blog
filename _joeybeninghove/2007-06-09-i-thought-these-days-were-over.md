I mean, come on [Movielink](http://www.movielink.com/).&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t it clear by now that IE is not the only kid on the block anymore?&nbsp; Is your html markup and css \*that\* bad that you won&#8217;t even \*attempt\* to display it in Firefox?&nbsp; Maybe a tiny kudos for at least telling people about the [IE Tab extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419), which is also&nbsp;very handy&nbsp;when doing intranet-based IE-only development.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Otherwise, a major &#8220;thumbs down&#8221; on this obvious&nbsp;lack of even attempting to adhere to web standards.
