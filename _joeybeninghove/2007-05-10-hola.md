Thanks [Jason](http://lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/default.aspx), for getting me set up over here at [LosTechies](http://lostechies.com/).&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to contributing my thoughts and experiences as I continue down the path of this agile/.NET software consultant thang.&nbsp; ðŸ™‚

In case you didn&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve been blogging for quite a while over at [my original blog](http://joeydotnet.com/blog).&nbsp; So if you&#8217;re interested in reading up on some of my old stuff, feel free.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll probably continue to cross-post over there as well.&nbsp; 

Things that are of particular interest to me these days are learning and applying domain-driven design concepts in my projects as well as leveraging some of the awesome open-source .NET frameworks out there like NHibernate and the Castle Project, especially MonoRail.&nbsp; So you can pretty much expect posts along those lines as well as the occasional &#8220;ReSharper is the best tool you can possibly buy as a .NET developer&#8221;-type post.

Anyways, adios for now.
