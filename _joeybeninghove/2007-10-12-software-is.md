A friend and former colleague of mine&nbsp;has finally [started blogging](http://blog.softwareishardwork.com/), after a year of
  
me heckling him.&nbsp; ðŸ˜›&nbsp; Basically&nbsp;Daniel is the guy I go to for schooling me
  
on&nbsp;some of those touchy areas of WinForms (ugh), threading and the occasional
  
lesson in IL.&nbsp; Umm, yeah.

Looking forward to some good content DPB.&nbsp; ðŸ˜€
