#### MonoRail, still my preference for .NET

Well during my recent 2 month blogging hiatus I&#8217;ve gotten settled into my first project at the new consulting firm I recently joined, and have had quite a few other things going on.&nbsp; 

This first project is interesting because, believe it or not, it&#8217;s really my first e-commerce project, which I&#8217;m really liking.&nbsp; The fact that I&#8217;m getting to use&nbsp;MonoRail and Windsor for most it is just icing on the cake.&nbsp; This is my 3rd &#8220;professional&#8221; project using MonoRail and I have to say it is a joy.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t even imagine going back to &#8220;classic&#8221; web forms in ASP.NET.&nbsp; 

**But&#8230; this post is not really about .NET**. 

#### A change in direction&nbsp; 

In fact, something else much more&nbsp;interesting has got my attention these days.&nbsp; Like other [&#8216;softies](http://www.softiesonrails.com/), I&#8217;m really starting to get infected with the Ruby bug (and of course Rails).&nbsp; I&#8217;m trying to look past all the hype, and let RoR speak for itself.&nbsp; So far, I have to say, it is quite impressive. 

For the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been doing quite a bit of reading and watching presentations/screencasts all dealing with Ruby and the Rails framework.&nbsp; A few of which are: 

  * [Ruby on Rails Screencast 1 &#8211; DHH](http://video.google.com/url?docid=8587824103285617709&esrc=sr3&ev=v&q=ruby%2Bon%2Brails&srcurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Ddy4UhY3gdC0&vidurl=%2Fvideoplay%3Fdocid%3D8587824103285617709%26q%3Druby%2Bon%2Brails%26total%3D319%26start%3D0%26num%3D10%26so%3D0%26type%3Dsearch%26plindex%3D2&usg=AL29H20WOrnH3CgJvs5LANXkpeacaeIb5w)

              * [The keynotes from last year&#8217;s RailsConf 2006](http://www.scribemedia.org/?s=railsconf&x=12&y=13) 
                  * Along with many, many others&#8230;</ul> 
                One of my main principles when coding is readability and expressiveness, along with DRY, SRP and a handful of others.&nbsp; In C#, you can certainly write code that is somewhat elegant (more on that later), but it never seems as easy as it should be.&nbsp; Needless to say, I really like what I&#8217;ve seen of Ruby so far.&nbsp; And coupled with the Rails framework, it looks like a very promising way to produce **quick AND clean** web applications.
                
                I&#8217;ve just purchased [Agile Web Development with Rails](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html) (PDF Version), and am currently going through it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to try and post some chapter by chapter reviews of it here on my blog as well as my experiences in general&nbsp;as I go through the learning process.&nbsp; 
                
                #### So what does this mean for joey**DotNet**?
                
                Well, perhaps it was silly of me to tie my identity so closely to a particular technology, but since I am still mainly doing .NET in my &#8220;day job&#8221;, I&#8217;ll keep it for now.&nbsp; But if things progress how I expect, I may need &#8220;[a fresh cup](http://afreshcup.com/)&#8221; at some point.
