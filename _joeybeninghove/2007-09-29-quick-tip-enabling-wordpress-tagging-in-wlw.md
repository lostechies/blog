I&#8217;ve been playing with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) a little
  
over the past couple days (for [our new family
  
site](http://beninghove.com/) we&#8217;re trying to start) and it&#8217;s a pretty sweet product.&nbsp; In their
  
latest version 2.3 they have full tagging support but at first glance the only
  
thing Windows Live Writer would allow me to do is set up categories for
  
WordPress which are not the same.&nbsp; I prefer tagging for its simplicity.&nbsp; 

So after some searching I found that WLW looks for a file named
  
&#8220;wlwmanifest.xml&#8221; to discover what features are available for the particular
  
blog engine your using.&nbsp; So all you have to do is [download this WLW manifest file](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5023)
  
designed for WordPress, and then upload it to the root of your blog.

This allows you to use a nice little box in WLW to enter &#8220;keywords&#8221; which get
  
translated into &#8220;tags&#8221; when posting to WordPress.
