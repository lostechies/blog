I ran across this pretty nifty looking launcher/productivity tool called [Enso](http://humanized.com/enso/).&nbsp; I&#8217;ve downloaded the launcher and
  
have been playing with it.&nbsp; Unlike most everybody else, I haven&#8217;t switched to
  
Launchy yet from Slickrun.&nbsp; (I \*heart\* Slickrun!).&nbsp; Launchy just seemed a little
  
to &#8220;pretty&#8221; for me I guess.&nbsp; Slickrun is fast and its &#8220;magic
  
words&#8221;&nbsp;have&nbsp;integrated&nbsp;themselves deeply into my work habits.

At first glance, Enso looks similar to Launchy, but from [watching the demo](http://humanized.com/enso_demo.php), it seems to
  
have some distinct advantages over your typical &#8220;launcher&#8221;.&nbsp; Although it will
  
probably take me a little while to get used to holding down the Caps key while
  
doing everything.

Anyone else played with Enso?&nbsp; Do you like it better than Launchy and/or
  
Slickrun?
