I just have to share this.&nbsp; So my wife asks me why I&#8217;m learning this new thing called Ruby.&nbsp; She&#8217;s usually not interested in the specifics of the programming languages I use.&nbsp; (A few years ago, she asked me, &#8220;what&#8217;s that C-Pound book you&#8217;re reading?&#8221;&nbsp; ðŸ™‚

So I broke out a pen and paper and wrote these 2 lines:

  * DateTime.Now.AddHours(1) 
      * 1.hour.from_now</ul> 
    I asked her which one did she think was easier to understand.&nbsp; She said &#8220;obviously, the 2nd one&#8221;.&nbsp; Bingo!
    
    Then I wrote her another couple of lines:
    
      * for (int i=0; i<=3; i++) {&nbsp;// do something&nbsp;} 
          * 3.times.do //something</ul> 
        Same question and she pointed at the first one in disgust and again said the 2nd was much easier to write.&nbsp; Then she asked me why I&#8217;m not doing everything using the 2nd one.&nbsp; Sadly, I couldn&#8217;t really come with a good answer to that one except to say that it&#8217;s just now gaining traction (even though it&#8217;s been around for long time), it&#8217;s open source, it doesn&#8217;t come from Microsoft, blah blah.
        
        Needless to say, the fact that my wife is telling me I need to start using Ruby more is definitely a sign.&nbsp; Just not sure of _what_ it&#8217;s a sign of&#8230;
