Well, this post is more of the personal variety, but it may affect future posts in one way or another (however, [not like this](http://lostechies.com/blogs/sean_chambers/archive/2008/02/26/what-happened-to-you-ve-been-haacked.aspx)).&nbsp; In short, a season of change is upon me.

 <img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px" src="http://joeydotnet.com/images/fall_change.jpg" align="right" />

Big change #1.&nbsp; I&#8217;m getting out of the consulting world for a while.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been grand and I&#8217;ve learned a ton about people, business and technology.&nbsp; But I felt it was time for something different.&nbsp; Because of the types of consulting firms I&#8217;ve worked with the past 3 years, the one thing I haven&#8217;t liked is that I never got to work on a team long enough to really get to know the folks I was working with very well.&nbsp; Seems like just when my team and I were really getting productive together, we&#8217;d all get thrown to different projects, usually with folks we hadn&#8217;t worked with before.&nbsp; Obviously some of this has to do with the nature of consulting in general, but I&#8217;m sure some firms see the value in keeping teams together as much as possible than others.

Big change #2.&nbsp; Like [Chad](http://lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/03/03/ping-pong-pairing-it-s-not-just-for-breakfast-anymore.aspx), I also started a new job this week, for a great product company.&nbsp; The company is small, which I really like, especially when talking about small development teams.&nbsp; I&#8217;m hoping to learn a lot (drinking from the firehose this week) and be a good contributor along side the other couple developers on the team.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an interesting product with some pretty unique challenges to tackle, from what I&#8217;ve seen so far.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be doing mostly ASP.NET work, with maybe a little mobile device stuff thrown in for good measure.

Big change #3.&nbsp; I&#8217;m joining the world of [web workers](http://webworkerdaily.com/)!&nbsp; Yep, I&#8217;m now working from home exclusively.&nbsp; This might be the biggest change for me in all of this, but I&#8217;m very much looking forward to adapting to this type of lifestyle/work environment.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have some things to learn, specifically about how to keep things balanced, but so far it&#8217;s been enjoyable.&nbsp; Not to mention, it&#8217;ll help me kick the &#8220;eating out&#8221; habit that I was stuck in during my traditional office jobs.&nbsp; :O

So far I&#8217;m finding that my reliance on tools like [IM](http://www.pidgin.im/), [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) and [SharedView](http://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=94) (which is pretty decent) just grew exponentially.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to possibly trying out some [remote pairing](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2007/09/17/skype-yugma-logitech-premium-usb-headset-350-remote-pair-programming.aspx) as soon as I get settled.

To make this post at least somewhat productive, here are a couple tools and a bonus tip that I&#8217;ve been introduced to over the past couple days that you may find useful.

  * [Pidgin-Encryption](http://pidgin-encrypt.sourceforge.net/) (for&#8230;umm&#8230;encryption) 
      * [Hamachi](https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/vpn.asp) (really nice and free VPN software)</ul> 
    Bonus Tip: I&#8217;ve been a huge Pidgin fan ever since it had that weird Gaim name.&nbsp; I use it for everything.&nbsp; AIM, Yahoo, GTalk, IRC, Twitter.&nbsp; One tip that I learned today is how to set up Pidgin to &#8220;auto join&#8221; you to a particular IRC channel as soon as you login into Pidgin.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s how to do it&#8230;
    
      1. Click Buddies > Add Chat 
          * Choose your IRC account/server from the Account drop-down 
              * Type the name of the channel you want to join 
                  * Give the chat an alias (I just used the channel name) 
                      * Click Add 
                          * Now find that new chat in your list of buddies, Right-Click > Auto-join 
                              * That&#8217;s it!</ol> 
                            So now when you fire up Pidgin, it&#8217;ll automatically join you to that room.&nbsp; Most of you may already know about this, but I thought it was pretty cool.
                            
                            Anyway, until next time.&nbsp; I have a lot of things to blog about in the hopper.&nbsp; Hopefully I can get around to them sometime soon.&nbsp; \*sigh\*
