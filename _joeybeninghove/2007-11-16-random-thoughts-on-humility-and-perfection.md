(Sorry for the recent&nbsp;codeless posts, but these are just some of the things I&#8217;ve been thinking about and dealing with recently)

As I continue down this road as a software consultant (still with a consulting firm), I find myself working more and more with other consultants who are considered &#8220;senior&#8221;, which for some reason includes myself.&nbsp; I&#8217;m starting to&nbsp;see that this&nbsp;_can_ be one of the biggest roadblocks to change and one of the biggest producers of fear on a team.&nbsp; At least speaking for myself.&nbsp; 

> &#8220;We&#8217;re &#8216;Senior&#8217;, We Don&#8217;t Need No Stinkin&#8217;&nbsp;Code Reviews&#8221;

This is the kind of mentality that, though common,&nbsp;is pretty unfortunate.&nbsp; We all know code reviews have been abused over the years, but does that really mean there is no benefit in &#8220;having&nbsp;a 2nd pair of eyes&#8221;, as they say?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t this still&nbsp;a powerful way to learn and grow a team&#8217;s skills?&nbsp; 

But this&nbsp;post is not about specific practices like code reviews.&nbsp; The greater point I&#8217;m trying to make is this:&nbsp; **Is it possible for us all&nbsp;to put down our &#8220;senior&#8221; statuses and strive for perfection as a group of passionate developers without the fear&nbsp;of offending each other?**&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure this is completely achievable as long as we&#8217;re all allowed to have opinions, but it certainly sounds like a nice goal.&nbsp; 

Even though perfection is unachievable, I want to get as close to it as I can.&nbsp; Both, in my walk with the Lord and in my craft as a software developer.&nbsp; 

One of the main benefits I see to all this ALT.NET stuff is that when a group of developers (notice I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;senior developers&#8221;) can get together and critique each other&#8217;s ideas in a constructive way that actually leads to overall improvement and learning, then I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a huge leap in the right direction.

> &#8220;Now Let&#8217;s Not Get Crazy And Actually Try To Improve Our Code&#8221;

**Fear quenches the ability to improve.**&nbsp; If Joe Developer is afraid to make a suggestion to another developer or his team&nbsp;because he&#8217;s afraid&nbsp;of either a)&nbsp;someone getting offended&nbsp;and/or b) someone biting his head off, then chances are that the&nbsp;team&#8217;s&nbsp;overall skills are pretty stagnant and their ability to improve is severely limited.&nbsp; Fear can also come from working with unwieldy code bases.&nbsp; When&nbsp;everyone on the team is&nbsp;afraid to change anything because they don&#8217;t want to break something, then you&#8217;ve got some serious changes to implement.&nbsp; I&#8217;m starting to go through this process now on a couple of my current projects.&nbsp; One baby step at a time.

> &#8220;We&#8217;re Too Busy&nbsp;To Learn Fundamental OO Principles And Practices&#8221;

Well, like a good friend of mine told me recently, &#8220;you&#8217;re gonna pay for it somewhere&#8221;.&nbsp; Either through lots of pain in the ongoing maintenance of poorly designed software or in the investment into your team to learn/teach better ways of&nbsp;building software in the first place.

Now that I&#8217;ve pretty much &#8220;settled in&#8221; to my new consulting&nbsp;firm, I&#8217;m going to really start spreading the knowledge that I have (what little that is) to try and build up the teams I work with as much as I can and perhaps [encourage others to do the same](http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/LeadingByMultiplicity.aspx).&nbsp; Because I know that ultimately by doing this, I&#8217;ll end up learning much more from other folks that I could possibly teach them.

The end goal of course being that the clients we **serve** are getting the highest quality work possible.&nbsp; But more on that in another post&#8230;&nbsp; ðŸ˜‰
