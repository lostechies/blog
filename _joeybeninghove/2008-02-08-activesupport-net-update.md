So it seems there is some interest in getting something like this up and running.&nbsp; I went ahead and did some of the basic &#8220;project setup&#8221; type tasks.&nbsp; Here are some links of interest&#8230;

  * [ActiveSupport.NET Google Code Project](http://activesupportnet.googlecode.com) 
      * [ActiveSupport.NET.Discuss](http://groups.google.com/group/activesupportnet-discuss) (general) 
          * [ActiveSupport.NET.Developers](http://groups.google.com/group/activesupportnet-developers) (for future use once we have some a group of committers) </ul> 
        I look forward to some more discussions about the best way to structure things to make it easy to use.&nbsp; On the google code project site you&#8217;ll find a brief description of the project as well as a wiki page I&#8217;ve started to give some basic info on how the code base is structured (tools, build targets, etc&#8230;).&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure all of this will change/evolve as things progress.
        
        And thanks [Joe](http://blog.joelowrance.com/Default.aspx) (for already submitting the first patch) and others that have said they want to get involved.&nbsp; Should be fun&#8230;&nbsp; ðŸ™‚
