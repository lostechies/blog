Well apparently [Derik](http://devlicio.us/blogs/derik_whittaker/default.aspx) is trying to bring me out of my blogging hiatus by [tagging me](http://devlicio.us/blogs/derik_whittaker/archive/2008/06/24/how-did-i-get-started-in-software-development.aspx) with the meme of the week.&nbsp; ðŸ™‚&nbsp; My story is pretty boring, but I&#8217;ll play along in an effort to bring me out of my recent break from the blogosphere.

**How old were you when you started programming?**

I suppose I was 14 (9th grade) when I first started dabbling on an Apple IIe with all the joys of line numbers and &#8220;gotos&#8221;.&nbsp; I enjoyed it but I definitely wasn&#8217;t as smart as the kid who created a program to generate one of those &#8220;magic eye&#8221; pictures that were all the rage at the time.&nbsp; Besides, I was a band geek for most of my high school days (drums).

**What was your first language?**

I guess technically Apple Basic and QBasic were my first languages where I would mess with my Mom by writing stupid little QBasic programs to simulate her computer exploding.&nbsp; Ahh, those were the days.&nbsp; But I would probably say that my Pascal class in 11th grade was where I really started to learn how to create stuff and solve problems by typing &#8220;codes&#8221; into some crazy thing called a &#8220;computer&#8221;.****

**What was the first real program you wrote?**

Probably the first &#8220;real&#8221; program I ever wrote was a Pick 3 lottery program in my Pascal class followed later by a standard 5 card draw poker game, with stunning graphics!&nbsp; ðŸ™‚&nbsp; Looking back, I&#8217;m not sure if those were assigned projects or if I came up with those on my own, but regardless, either the school was encouraging the students to write gambling software or I had some weird attraction to writing software that could possibly ruin people&#8217;s lives.&nbsp; Both equally disturbing&#8230; LOL.****

**If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?**

Oh yeah.&nbsp; I actually started my &#8220;professional&#8221; career on the hardware/networking side of things but ultimately I always knew I was a codemonkey at heart and eventually moved in that direction professionally.&nbsp; Besides, the money is a heck of a lot better too.&nbsp; ðŸ™‚

**If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?**

So, what&#8217;s my size limit for this answer?&nbsp; ðŸ˜€

Well of course I&#8217;d say to have fun and be passionate and all that jazz.&nbsp; To me, that&#8217;s just a given.&nbsp; But also to focus on [the fundamentals](http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2008/06/24/foundations-of-programming-ebook.aspx).&nbsp; Learn \*why\* it&#8217;s important to make testability and maintainability a first-level concern when building software.&nbsp; Get started in the community early because you&#8217;ll make some great friends and learn a ton along the way.&nbsp; I could say a ton more, but I don&#8217;t think the internet could hold them all.

**What&#8217;s the most fun you&#8217;ve ever had &#8230; programming?**

Not sure I can pinpoint a single time, but the times I&#8217;ve been able to do some greenfield projects and make testability a first-class citizen in the design, I&#8217;ve been very happy with the results.&nbsp; Also the journey towards &#8220;beautiful code&#8221; is something that I enjoy very much.&nbsp; Getting creative and coming up with new and useful ways of wiring something together or even just naming a method well is enough to make me happy.&nbsp; 

Recently, I&#8217;d say that my brief stint in the Rails world (not professionally) was the most fun I&#8217;ve had coding in quite a while.&nbsp; Perhaps that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m getting the Ruby itch again.

**The poor saps that I&#8217;m tagging?**
