Brad Mead asked a question on my [previous
  
post](/blogs/joeydotnet/archive/2010/06/23/from-alt-net-to-not-net.aspx)
  
about my favorite community hang outs, lists, sites, etc. Instead of posting a long comment reply, I decided to turn it
  
into a post of its own.

If you don&#8217;t like link posts, then you might want to skip this one. But I always end up
  
picking up a couple things from other folks that share their online resources, so maybe this will do that for someone else
  
too. This post is kinda aimed at corporate-ish developers that maybe aren&#8217;t already plugged in too much. For the rest
  
of you, a lot of this might just be obvious.

## Blogs

I don&#8217;t follow too many individual bloggers. In fact, I actually don&#8217;t read that many blogs at all these days. But the
  
ones I do check occassionally are usually aggregate blogs that give me a pretty good sense of what&#8217;s going on in the
  
world of Ruby.

  * [Ruby Inside](http://www.rubyinside.com)
  * [Rails Inside](http://www.railsinside.com)
  * [Ruby Flow](http://rubyflow.com)
  * [Rails Dispatch](http://railsdispatch.com) &#8211; Just &#8217;cause there are some great Rails 3 articles
  * many, many more out there, but that&#8217;s just a few

## Screencasts

I&#8217;m a big fan of screencasts. I tend to learn quite a bit from watching other people write code. Maybe you do too.

  * [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com) $$ &#8211; THE place to get your Ruby screencast fix (I&#8217;ve got a full subscription)
  * [Tekpub](http://tekpub.com) $$ &#8211; Pretty good series on building your own blog in Rails and a Rack screencast
  * [Gregg Pollack&#8217;s Rails 3 Screencasts](http://rubyonrails.org/screencasts/rails3)
  * [RubyPulse](http://www.rubypulse.com) &#8211; Nice, short ruby screencasts
  * [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com) &#8211; Nice, short rails screencasts
  * [raleigh.rb videos](http://raleighrb.com) &#8211; Videos of user group talks from Raleigh
  * [SD Ruby videos](http://sdruby.org/podcast) &#8211; More good videos of user group talks in San Deigo
  * [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org) &#8211; Not Ruby related, but had to get my Vim plug in somehow&#8230; ðŸ™‚

## Podcasts

Considering I work at home nearly 100% of the time (with the exception an occasional nomading trip to Starbucks), I
  
don&#8217;t get much driving time to listen to podcasts. But I manage to squeeze in some time during my trips to Chipotle and late at
  
night to listen to a few. Here are some of the Ruby/OSS related ones.

  * [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com)
  * [The Dev Show](http://5by5.tv/devshow)
  * [The Ruby Show](http://5by5.tv/rubyshow)
  * [Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://podcast.rubyonrails.org)
  * [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com)

## Github

You&#8217;ll want to get very familiar with GitHub and the community surrounding it. Since who/what you follow largely
  
depends on what specific gems or frameworks you&#8217;re using, I won&#8217;t list specific ones here. But suffice it to say, that
  
GitHub plays a huge role in bringing the Ruby community together. Git wit it!

## IRC/Mailing Lists

I&#8217;m grouping these two together since they tend to go hand in hand. Once you start using a particular Ruby
  
gem/framework out there, you&#8217;ll usually find they have an associated mailing list and/or IRC channel. I like to use
  
mailing lists mostly for learning interesting tidbits from other people&#8217;s questions and throwing out the occasional
  
question myself. IRC is great when you need to get some help (or give some help) in a &#8216;just in time&#8217; type of way. I
  
know I mentioned it in my previous post, but it is quite amazing how helpful the folks in the Ruby and open source
  
communities can be. Even for newbies like me&#8230; ðŸ™‚

## Conferences

I&#8217;ve yet to go to a Ruby-related conference, but hopefully I&#8217;ll make it to one sometime soon. Probably the best way to
  
find these is just to [google for
  
them](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ruby+conferences&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).

## User Groups

If you can&#8217;t make it to a conference, perhaps look for (or start) a Ruby users group in your area. I&#8217;ve started
  
attending our local [CVREG](http://cvreg.org) group and it&#8217;s been great. I&#8217;ve met some great folks so far and
  
hope to get much more involved in the local Ruby community.

## Twitter

I admit that a lot of my community interaction does happen over Twitter. I went through my followers and created a
  
[Ruby list](http://twitter.com/joeybeninghove/ruby) which you can follow if you&#8217;re interested in some of the Ruby folks
  
I follow.
