<span style="font-weight: bold">Update: Zip file links have been updated due to the first one being corrupt!</span> 

Well it was bound to happen at some point.&nbsp; My [first screencast](http://screencast.lostechies.com/screencasts/joeyb/monorail%5Fquickly/index.html).&nbsp; It&#8217;s a quick walkthrough on how you can get a baseline MonoRail solution up and running.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp; Everyone&#8217;s talking about MS MVC these days, and I&#8217;m certainly just as excited about it as anyone else.&nbsp; But MonoRail is still a very nice MVC framework that can be fully leveraged **now.&nbsp;** 

So I thought [this screencast](http://screencast.lostechies.com/screencasts/joeyb/monorail%5Fquickly/index.html) along with its [accompanying zip file](http://code.google.com/p/joeydotnet/downloads/list) might help folks interested in MonoRail, or just ASP.NET MVC frameworks in general, to get one up and running quickly with everything you need (including an automated build script).

Let me know what you think!

(Thanks to my fellow [LosTechies](http://lostechies.com) crew for hosting the screencast for me.)

Happy Coding!
