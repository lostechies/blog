[Jay Flowers](http://jayflowers.com/) came down to our humble [Richmond DNUG](http://richmonddotnet.org/) tonight to talk about Continuous Integration and his rockin&#8217; open-source product, [CI Factory](http://jayflowers.com/WordPress/?p=201).&nbsp; It was a great demonstration of how to get a very robust automated build server up and running in literally minutes.&nbsp; Having set up quite a few automated build and CI environments myself over the years, I have a great appreciation for all the hard work that&#8217;s gone into a product like CI Factory.&nbsp; 

So I&#8217;m looking forward to leveraging CI Factory in my future CI server implementations (which will hopefully be soon!)

Oh and some of the cool stuff he&#8217;s done in extending CCNet and NAnt was pretty impressive as well.&nbsp; Not to mention the extension of NCover to drive and generate code coverage for WatiN tests.

So if you need CI (and trust me, you do), then [download CI Factory](http://jayflowers.com/WordPress/?p=201) and check it out.
