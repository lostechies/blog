> _When wisdom enters your heart, And knowledge is pleasant to your soul, Discretion will preserve you; Understanding will keep you, &#8212; [Proverbs 2:10-11](http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/tools/printer-friendly.pl?book=Pro&chapter=002&version=nkjv#10)_

One of the reasons I blog and specifically, post code to my blog, is that I really learn a lot from other folks in the community.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re all one big team, sitting in a &#8220;virtual&#8221; collaborative environment, constantly striving for perfection (which will never happen, of course). 

An interesting thing about this, is that it requires one of the core values of XP, Courage.&nbsp; I truly never know how what I post is going to be received.&nbsp; A lot of times it&#8217;s just some crazy idea that I&#8217;m experimenting with or more often it&#8217;s applying and/or extending&nbsp;something I&#8217;ve picked up from someone else.&nbsp; Either way, sometimes it&#8217;s good to hear &#8220;you&#8217;re crazy&#8221; or &#8220;well, I would&#8217;ve done it like this&#8221;, because it allows me to learn different/better ways of doing things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it sometimes stings.&nbsp; Though I&#8217;ve noticed&nbsp;that as I progress into&nbsp;more of an agile developer, &nbsp;the sting lessens.&nbsp; Because after all, &#8220;[there are no smart guys, there&#8217;s only us](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/05/21/thoughts-rants-and-arguments-my-devteach-2007-rollup.aspx)&#8220;.

Of course this&nbsp;is beneficial to&nbsp;me, but more importantly, it will hopefully benefit the teams and clients that I work with.
