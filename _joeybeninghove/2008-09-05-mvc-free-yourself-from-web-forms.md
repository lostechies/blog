Thanks to all who came out last night to hear my talk on MVC at the <a href="http://richmonddotnet.org" target="_blank">Richmond .NET User Group</a>.&nbsp; It was a blast.&nbsp; I wish we had more time to dig into some more code, but maybe next time.&nbsp; 90 minutes flies by!

As promised, here are the <a href="http://joeydotnet.com/blogattachments/MVC_FreeYourselfFromWebForms.pptx" target="_blank">slides from the presentation</a>.
