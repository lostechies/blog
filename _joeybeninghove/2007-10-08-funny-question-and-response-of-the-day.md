A co-worker of mine sent an email with this question to the whole&nbsp;&#8220;dev&#8221;
  
group:

> &#8220;Does anyone have a random password generator that I can quickly plug into my
  
> application?&#8221;

My response:

> &#8220;Guid.NewGuid().ToString()&#8221;&nbsp; ðŸ˜›

What&#8217;s even funnier is that my team lead sent the exact same response
  
(Guid).&nbsp; Others replied with &#8220;google &#8216;.net random password generator'&#8221;.&nbsp;
  
LOL.

The correct answer turned out to be:

> System.Web.Security.Membership.GeneratePassword

But of course&nbsp;that&#8217;s not nearly as funny, now is it&#8230;
