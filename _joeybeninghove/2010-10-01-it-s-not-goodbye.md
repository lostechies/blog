Hey there folks,

It&#8217;s a bittersweet moment for me, but the time has come for me to relaunch my personal blog/brand back under my own name. &nbsp;I truly appreciate everything Jason, Joe and everyone else in this community has done for me over the years. &nbsp;There are an awesome group of folks here in this community and I&#8217;ve enjoyed being a part of seeing it grow. &nbsp;I wish everyone here great success and I look forward to seeing where the donkey takes this community. &nbsp;ðŸ™‚

Of course thanks to the twitters and the interwebs, this isn&#8217;t goodbye&#8230; just a relocation or readdressing, if you will.

I&#8217;m still putting some final touches on things, but if you&#8217;re interested in following me at my new home:
