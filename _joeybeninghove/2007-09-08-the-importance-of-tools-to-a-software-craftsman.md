> _And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship &#8212; [Exodus 31:3](http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Exd/Exd031.html#3)_

Folks often wonder why I carry [my keyboard](http://joeydotnet.com/blog/archive/2007/04/26/Some-mouseless-computing-tipstools.aspx) around with me everywhere there is a chance I need to write some code.&nbsp; Bringing it home every night from work, carrying it with me to client sites, etc.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s my (possibly feeble)&nbsp;attempt to try and give an answer as to why.

I like the term [software craftsman](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/09/02/what-would-you-say-you-do-here.aspx) very much.&nbsp; For example, I&#8217;m sure folks who do carpentry for a living have their favorite tool(s) that they have mastered.&nbsp; This allows them to produce some beautiful work with great attention to detail.&nbsp; And the fact that they have&nbsp;learned to use&nbsp;their tool(s) **effectively**&nbsp;probably means they can work very **efficiently**.

This is exactly how I see the tools I use to build software.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s face it, you&#8217;re not going to get very far building software without a good keyboard.&nbsp; And I&#8217;d go one step further and say you&#8217;re not going to build software very **efficiently** if you&#8217;re not using your keyboard **effectively**.&nbsp; And that applies to more than just your keyboard of course.&nbsp; For all of you other &#8216;softies out there that have to use Visual Studio, if you&#8217;re not using&nbsp;a productivity add-in like [CodeRush](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/CodeRush/Index.xml), or my long-time favorite, [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), then you&#8217;re not working anywhere near as efficiently as&nbsp;you could/should be working.&nbsp; And frankly, it&#8217;s not that hard to point out the [overwhelming value](http://blog.eleutian.com/2007/02/10/TheImportanceOfDevelopmentTools.aspx) that such tools can bring vs. their cost.

So I guess I would just encourage folks to acquire and learn to master the tools necessary to be as productive as you possibly can as a software craftsman.&nbsp;
