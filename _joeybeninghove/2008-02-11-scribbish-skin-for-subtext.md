This is long overdue, but [Nick Parker](http://developernotes.com/) asked me a long time ago (sorry Nick) where I got the skin I use for my (joeyDotNet.com) blog and I told him I&#8217;d make it available.&nbsp; I actually ported it myself from the existing [Scribbish theme](http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish) that was already available for Mephisto, WordPress and others.&nbsp; I really liked the simplicity of it so I just grabbed the CSS and hacked away at it myself until I got it looking close enough as a [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/) skin.

I submitted it to the [Subtext skins showcase](http://subtextskins.com/), but it may take a bit for it to get approved.&nbsp; So for now, you can just [download it from here](http://joeydotnet.com/blogattachments/scribbish.zip).

I kind of put this together in a hurry, so please let me know if you find any problems with it.

Enjoy!&nbsp; ðŸ™‚
