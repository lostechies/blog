I&#8217;ve made quite a few changes to how I work over the years, specifically my monitor count. I&#8217;ve tried varieties of one, two and even three monitors. But interestingly, for me, one large monitor seems perfect&#8230; well, almost&#8230;

Obviously, you can only fit so much on a single screen before you end up with a noisy mess of windows and documents.

This is one of the reasons why I like Spaces so much and they work even better(ish) in the most recent version of OSX Lion.

What I&#8217;ve done is set a unique background to a desktop and then assigned related apps so that they stay with the view. This makes it easy to keep my desktop organized without needing multiple monitors.

Some apps I don&#8217;t assign to a specific desktop (browsers). In some cases it might make sense to assign them to all desktops so they are easier to access (for example, Finder).

### The Wallpapers

Feel free to use the wallpapers and if you can think of one that is missing, let me know (Include the text and a link to the icon use). Obviously, you can use any apps for the backgrounds but below are some suggestions.
