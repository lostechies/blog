I&#8217;ve had a busy past couple of weeks &#8211; I&#8217;ve started a new job, packed and prepared to finalize the sale of my house &#8211; and now, **I&#8217;m joining Los Techies!**

My name is Hugo Bonacci &#8211; I work for [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com) as a designer/developer and in my spare time I write code or work on geek projects with my kids.

It&#8217;s hard to sum up the sorts of topics you&#8217;ll see out of me but I&#8217;ll probably be mostly focused on UI and client facing interactions with web development. You&#8217;ll see a lot of JavaScript and ASP.NET MVC (maybe a hint of Ruby from time to time until I have something worth sharing :))

I&#8217;m not particularly opinionated so I won&#8217;t be posting much about the right or wrong way to do things &#8211; just interesting tips and tricks that might help as you&#8217;re creating web sites.

My personal site can be found at [hugoware.com](http://hugoware.com) where you can look at some of [my projects](http://hugoware.com/projects) and [other blog posts](http://hugoware.com/blog). You can also [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/hugoware).

Anyways, I&#8217;m looking forward to blogging here and I&#8217;ll have more soon!
