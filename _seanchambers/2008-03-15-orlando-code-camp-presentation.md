I will be doing a presentation at the [Orlando Code Camp](http://www.orlandocodecamp.com/){.} on next Saturday on March 22nd on Continuous Integration with TeamCity.


  


I will be mainly cover the topic of Continuous Integration and how teams can benefit from it, then I will show how TeamCity works and dive into some of the details with this great tool. <A class="" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</A> just released 3.1 which improved TeamCity in various ways.


  


If you are in the Orlando area you should definately try to get to the code camp. There is a lot of great topics lined up.


  


Hope to see you there!
