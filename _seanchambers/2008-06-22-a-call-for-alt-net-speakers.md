In an attempt to spread awareness in the North/Central Florida area on Alt.Net topics I am trying to gather speakers&nbsp;familiar with Alt.Net topics to speak at the <A class="" title="Jacksonville Code Camp" href="http://www.jaxcodecamp.com/" target="_blank">Jacksonville Code Camp</A> that is coming up on August 23rd.&nbsp;The&nbsp;topics I am envisioning are Domain Driven&nbsp;Design, TDD, BDD, NHibernate, ORM&#8217;s in general or any other topics that would be of interest in the alt.net space.


  


If you live in the central/north florida area and are interested in speaking at the code camp please register at <A class="" href="http://www.jaxcodecamp.com/" target="_blank">http://www.jaxcodecamp.com</A> and please contact me at dkode8 at gmail dot com. This way I can&nbsp;begin to organize an alt.net track at the event when I attend one of the planning meetings.


  


Hoping to hear from you!
