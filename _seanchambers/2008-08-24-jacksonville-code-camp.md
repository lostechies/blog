Jacksonville Code Camp was a great success. Even with faced with changing the venue only 48 hours before the event due to Tropical Storm Fay, Jonathan Bates and the rest of the team was able to pull it off with flying colors! I have great respect for these guys, they did an excellent job.


  


I will be posting the content on my blog here later this evening, for the time being in case you missed one of my sessions or are in need of some of the sample code I used in the TDD session, you can find the contact on the Google Code Repository here: <http://code.google.com/p/jaxcodecamp/>


  


Thank you for everyone that attended. Scott Reynolds had two great presentations on Agile and NDepend as well.
