I am wondering if anyone else has had experience with attempting to recognize a 500gb Western Digital MyBook HDD in either VirtualBox or VMWare.


  


I have been trying to get my ubuntu guest OS to see the drive for 2 hours or so and I can&#8217;t get it to work. Not even an error or anything. I know these drives are notorious for being a pain so I think it may actually be the drive.


  


Weird part is, it has to be plugged into a specific USB port in the back of my machine to work in Windows XP. It won&#8217;t work in the front two ports which is kind of strange. I believe that this external drive is just bricked.
