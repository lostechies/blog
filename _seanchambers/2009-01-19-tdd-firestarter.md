I want to thank everyone for coming out to the TDD Firestarter event that we had in Tampa yesterday. We had an excellent turnout (about 80 people), and everyone was very interested in getting to know TDD/BDD.

We are in the process of post-processing videos and getting the content together. We have complete videos of the entire presentation as well as presentations in breakout rooms after the main workshop. Expect the content to be posted later in the week.

I also want to thank everyone that helped with directing the video, answering questions and doing presentations in the breakout sessions. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without your help!!
