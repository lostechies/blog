This past weekend Jacksonville Code Camp took place at University of North Florida campus in Jacksonville. The event was very well organized and donations also went to Goodson’s Children’s Hospital. There was a silent auction fundraiser after the code camp at Sneakers in Jacksonville where all proceeds went towards the children’s hospital.

I did one presentation on SOLID Principles. As noted&#160; here are some relevant urls to information about my talk:

<http://github.com/schambers/solid-principles/tree/master>

At that repository is the presentation and all of the sample code I used during the presentation for your reference.

There was quite a few other interesting presentations. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jremsikjr" target="_blank">Jim Remsik</a> from HashRocket did a presentation on Agile Storycarding. One of the attendees took some video of the presentation and posted it on vurl which you <a href="http://qik.com/video/2709502" target="_blank">can find here</a>.

<a href="http://twitter.com/ByteMaster" target="_blank">Kevin Wolf</a> demo’d his <a href="http://ormsmackdown.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">ORM Smackdown</a> project that shows the differences between several different ORM frameworks along with some great information around each. Kevin definitely put a lot of effort into this detailing and looking at each ORM framework.

I didn’t have a chance to take an immense amount of photos but I did take about 40 that you can find here: <http://www.flickr.com/photos/schambers/sets/72157622065448379/>

Everyone had a great time and I am already looking forward to next year.

On a sidenote, next weekend (September 5th) is <a href="http://www.tallycodecamp.org/2009" target="_blank">Tally Code Camp in Tallahassee Florida</a>. Shaping up to be another great event. Try to make it out if you can!
