Over the last couple of months I have been casually looking at the job market in the Jacksonville/Orlando area at various opportunities. None of the really interested me and had mediocre opportunities at best. I was comfortable in my current job, but was looking for more of a challenge. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that in order for me to continue to gain
  
knowledge and strive for more experience, I needed to seek a new position with a strong development background; among many other reasons at the time of making these considerations. I felt the stench of stagnation, and in the development community everyone knows that stagnating is not where you want to be as stagnation == dead in the programming world. 

I saw that [Nate Kohari (author of Ninject) had just recently accepted a position](http://kohari.org/2008/08/21/joining-the-telligenti/) from [Telligent](http://www.telligent.com), and one thing led to another, I sent off my resume to [Scott Watermasysk](http://simpable.com/) and started the interview process at Telligent. After a very thorough interview process I accepted a position at Telligent as a Senior Software Development Engineer. I am extremely excited to start with a company on the rise like Telligent and eager work with a notable and knowledgable staff that is present at Telligent. I am looking forward to new challenges, new technologies and working in a new environment. I will be telecommuting from my home in Florida for this position which should present some new challenges in itself.

I will miss everyone that I have worked with at the School District over the years, and will stop in from time to time to say hello. Comfort zones are meant to be broken and any decent developer will always be striving for different challenges to overcome and new opportunities. Once you reach the top of one ladder, the only logical step is to look for the next one and continue climbing.
