Had a very long webinar this morning about some new software we&#8217;re looking at purchasing. The sales guy is showing us a bunch of features and blurts out the &#8220;AJAX&#8221; buzz word. I listen in more closely to see what he&#8217;s going to say. It goes something like this:


  


&#8220;This app was written completely with AJAX which is great!&#8221;, I correct him with &#8220;You mean that it **USES** AJAX right?&#8221;


  


He continues to insist that it is not .NET whatsoever and that AJAX is a family of programming languages which is what was used to make this great new application. Meanwhile I am staring at the page extensions of .aspx&#8230; I just rolled my eyes and bit my tongue. =)


  


Later on in the presentation he jumps back on the AJAX bandwagon to beat the horse some more and while showing a GridView control in a page states: &#8220;See this scrollbar with grid, this is all ajax &#8230;You can&#8217;t do this with any other programming language&#8221;, I correct him that the values he was changing&nbsp;within the grid&nbsp;was in fact AJAX because it was submitting behind the scenes, but the scrollbar was just a basic grid control that you can make with basic html.&nbsp;He&nbsp;cut me off and&nbsp;insisted again that the whole thing was AJAX. I just gave up at that point and listened to him ramble.


  


I had no idea that the &#8220;AJAX programming language&#8221; had arrived, Nor was I aware that this is now a buzzword that Sales guys use to sell software. Anything to get the dollars =)


  


After the meeting I was saying this to my boss and he says &#8220;That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s the sales guy&#8221;
