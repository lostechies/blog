FYI, <A class="" href="http://resharper.blogspot.com/2008/06/resharper-40-release-candidate.html" target="_blank">Just read this posting</A>, good news! Resharper 4 Release Candidate is now available. The last time I udpated from the nightly build has been pretty stable. A couple of minor bugs but no biggies.


  


&nbsp;Good job guys!
