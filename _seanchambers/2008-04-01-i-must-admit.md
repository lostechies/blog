Even though I haven&#8217;t been blogging alot recently on LosTechies, doesn&#8217;t mean I haven&#8217;t been blogging. Even though <A class="" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/04/01/i-am-pursefight.aspx" target="_blank">Bil Simser</A>, <A class="" href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/sergio_pereira/archive/2008/04/01/attention-major-announcement-that-will-change-everything.aspx" target="_blank">Sergio Pereira</A> and <A class="" href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/archive/2008/04/01/blame-canada.aspx" target="_blank">Kyle Baley</A> have all claimed to be ALT.NET Pursefight, they are indeed NOT!


  


**I am the true ALT.NET Pursefight!!!! Accept no substitute and believe noone else!**


  


Who else could it be? I am witty, intelligent and cool all wrapped up into one. This clearly makes me the ALT.NET Pursefight blogger. I am one of the &#8220;nobody developers&#8221; that would clearly end up being the ALT.NET Pursefight blogger. It&#8217;s as clear as mud!


  


At first I tried to chime in once or twice on the list only to get burned. This make me quite angry so rather then lash out I decided to don a cloak of anonymity and attack from behind the shadows. Genius eh? Before you ask I WILL NOT sign any autographs or kiss any babies.


  


That being said, the list has become quite boring recently so I urge everyone to start bickering again. Give me more blogging material! PLEASE!!!
