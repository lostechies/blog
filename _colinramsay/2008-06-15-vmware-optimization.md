Further to my earlier post on development enviroments, I wanted to share some ideas on how to work with Visual Studio in VMWare. Remember that running VMWare isn&#8217;t cost-free; you need to make sure that you&#8217;ve got resources to allocate to your virtual machine and that the virtual machine in question isn&#8217;t going to grind to a halt because you&#8217;re trying to do too much with it.
