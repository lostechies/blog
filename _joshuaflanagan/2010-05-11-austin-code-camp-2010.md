A reminder that <a href="http://codecamp.adnug.org/" target="_blank">Austin .NET User Group’s Code Camp</a> is in a couple days – Saturday, May 15 2010. Code Camp is always free, and registration is still open.

At 9am, I’ll be talking about “Leveraging conventions in .NET”. I’ll be walking through a few examples of how my team establishes and uses conventions in our day-to-day work to help us move fast. 

Some technologies I’ll touch on:

  * <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> – Should give you a good taste of its power, if you aren’t using it yet. There are a few more jQuery sessions at Code Camp so you can dive in deeper if you like what you see.
  * <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/" target="_blank">Fluent NHibernate</a> – even if you haven’t used FNH or NHibernate, you’ll still be able to appreciate the examples
  * <a href="http://fubumvc.com/" target="_blank">FubuMVC</a> – should also be interesting to ASP.NET MVC developers
