I got a kick out of <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2009/03/08/why-i-prefer-the-mvc-model-2-style-over-webforms.aspx" target="_blank">Jeremy’s eye poke at the ASP.NET WebForms</a> “simpler” approach to web development.

In the same spirit, remember how convoluted it was to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb398998.aspx" target="_blank">call simple JSON services from WebForms</a>? Well, my friend and former colleague <a href="http://shashankshetty.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Shashank Shetty</a> shows how it is done with <a href="http://shashankshetty.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/using-jsonresult-with-jquery-in-aspnet-mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC and jQuery</a> in his inaugural blog post.
