So… my blog may be going dark for a while… I don’t think I’m going to have a lot of free time for at least a few weeks, due to the ultimate ‘Hello World’ baby girl that my wife delivered on Wednesday morning @ 1:45am.

 <img style="border-bottom: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-right: 0px" border="0" alt="IMG_2186" src="https://lostechies.com/content/derickbailey/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2186_0A4A9FB4.jpg" width="180" height="240" />

I’ll get back to blogging some time I get back to sleeping, or start getting back to office – whichever comes first.
