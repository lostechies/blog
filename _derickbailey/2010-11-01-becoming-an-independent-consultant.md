After one year of a working with an amazing team and a great company at [TrackAbout](http://www.trackabout.com) (well, 361 days. 4 days shy of a year), I am moving on. Starting on Monday, November 15th, I will be a self-employed consultant! 

&#160;

### My First Gig: Learning Ruby On Rails, Full Time

The on-ramp to my new career is the contract that Iâ€™m taking which will land me square in the middle of full time Ruby on Rails development. Iâ€™ll be joining my former TrackAbout coworker and former LosTechies member, [Joey Beninghove](http://joeybeninghove.com/), working for the same client on the same project. Iâ€™m honored to be working with Joey again and to be given the opportunity to spend the first significant portion of my consulting career in Ruby on Rails.

&#160;

### No, Iâ€™m Not Abandoning .NET

Yes itâ€™s true that I have issue with certain things in .NET and I am excited to be moving into full time RoR work. But donâ€™t lump me in with the other â€˜abandon ship!â€™ people, just yet.

I have no intention of leaving behind the technologies that have supported my career so well, for the last 8 years. My plans for the future as a consultant include a fair amount of .NET work for many reasons, including the market in central Texas. I will continue to work on Albacore and other open source projects in .NET and I am likely to have various jaunts back into paying .NET work.

I am recognizing that I have a desire to be more than just a .NET developer, though, and I am doing something about it. Anyone that has followed me on this blog or twitter for the last year has seen the work Iâ€™ve done with Ruby and how Iâ€™ve learned more about what Iâ€™m doing with .NET by exploring that language. I hope to continue my learning and growth in more than just Ruby and I know that everything I do will serve to strengthen my abilities in any language I am working with.

My intention is to become a developer that actually can use the right tool for the job, instead of just say it and stick with .NET and a side of Ruby now and then.

&#160;

### Living The Dream

Letâ€™s just hope it doesnâ€™t turn into a waking nightmare. ðŸ™‚

As with anything new, Iâ€™m scared out of my mind at the moment. Iâ€™m sure there are going to be rough times ahead, but I have great expectations at the same time. Iâ€™ve been told time and time again, over the last 5 years or more, that I should go independent. Iâ€™ve finally made the move and Iâ€™m excited about the possibilities and what the future holds for me. 

&#160; 

### A New Company Name And More, Later

Iâ€™m in the process of reviving my old LLC, AvocadoSoftware. But Iâ€™m also working on a new company name and will be renaming AvocadoSoftware at some point in the near future. Iâ€™ll make some general announcements about that stuff as things happen. One of the benefits of having a contract in hand as I start this journey, though, is not having to fret too much about those details at first. I can take my time to get things set up right and move forward as I need to.

P.S. â€“ I promise not to spam the LosTechies readers with my company or blatant marketing. You may see me mention something now and then but Iâ€™ll have a separate blog for that, soon. I do expect to continue blogging here at LosTechies, though, continuing to talk about the tools and technology that I am learning.
