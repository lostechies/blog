I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of talking / presenting / writing about git in the last year or so, and I&#8217;ve been lucky in the last month to have a couple of high profile things related to this.

 

### Code Magazine

The may/june &#8217;11 issue of [Code Magazine has my &#8220;Git For Subversion Users&#8221; article](http://www.code-magazine.com/article.aspx?quickid=1105101) in it. The aim of the article is to help users who have a background in subversion, make the mental transition and paradigm shifts to git as a distributed source control system. I&#8217;ve heard a few people say that the article is also a good introduction to some of the git internals, even if you are a knowledgeable git user already. I cover more than just the basics of distributed vs centralized. I also cover topics such as the SHA-1 commit ID&#8217;s in git, why it&#8217;s necessary to specify your name and email in git&#8217;s configuration, and general workflow for individuals and small teams.

 

### AlamoCoders

I was also honored to speak at the [AlamoCoders group](http://www.alamocoders.org/) in May. It was a good presentation, I think. There was some good questions and comments from the audience, and they even recorded a video for it! You can watch the video on the [Alamocoders vimeo page](http://vimeo.com/24254657) now. Unfortunately, I only had an hour for this talk, so I had to rush through some of the topics and wasn&#8217;t able to get into collaboration with other developers in any kind of detail. I think it&#8217;s still a worthwhile talk to introduce git and help get people up and running with it.
