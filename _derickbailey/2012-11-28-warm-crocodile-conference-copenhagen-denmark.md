If you&#8217;ll be in the Copenhagen, Denmark area during the week of January 16 &#8211; 17, 2013, you should check out the [Warm Crocodile Conference](http://warmcrocconf.net/). I&#8217;m signed up to give a talk about scaling JavaScript applications with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [MarionetteJS](http://marionettejs.com/).

> The Warm Crocodile Conference is done by a small dedicated team inside of Microsoft as well as their beloved Crocodile, Claudia. Daniel Frost ([@danielovich](https://twitter.com/danielovich)), the mind behind the Warm Crocodile, is a proud community advocate & technologist preacher who works for Microsoft in Denmark. He has with the best and outstanding help from people like Henrik Westergaard & Martin Esmann and the Danish community built up over a decade worth of knowledge and know-how around developing software. We are all trying to lead software developers in the right direction and building conferences and communities around it, alongside the surronding technologies.

The abstract from the presentation I&#8217;ll be giving:

> Nearly everyone understands how to build a simple JavaScript application these days. From the classic &#8220;Todo&#8221; JavaScript app, to simple forms-over-data jQuery apps, we&#8217;ve all been around that block a few times. With the recent explosion of JavaScript MV* tools and frameworks, though, many of us find ourselves in over our heads, looking at patterns and practices that work well for small applications and pages but fail when scaling to anything substantial.
> 
> In this session, Derick Bailey will give you an introduction and walk through of many of the patterns and practices that your JavaScript applications need to be scalable. You&#8217;ll learn why copying Ruby on Rails&#8217; pattern of &#8220;Models&#8221;, &#8220;Views&#8221; and &#8220;Controllers&#8221; folder names is wrong for scaling JavaScript apps, and how to correct that . You&#8217;ll learn about the necessity of separating the various concerns of your application. You&#8217;ll learn about patterns that aggregate and coordinate functionality from other parts of the system, how and when to properly decouple disparate areas of your application through messaging patterns, and more. And all of this will be illustrated with Backbone, MarionetteJS and additional plugins and patterns that can give you an edge in creating scalable applications in JavaScript.

I hope to see you there!
