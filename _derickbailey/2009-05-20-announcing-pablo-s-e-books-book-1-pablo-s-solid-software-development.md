Hello World! I’m happy to announce the first Los Techies compiled, Pablo endorsed, E-Book: 

[**Pablo’s SOLID Software Development**](http://www.lostechies.com/content/pablo_ebook.aspx)

> _“S.O.L.I.D. is a collection of best-practice object-oriented design principles that you can apply to your design to accomplish various desirable goals like loose-coupling, higher maintainability, intuitive location of interesting code, etc.”_

This tremendous volume of information is a conglomeration of blog posts and other information produced by the LosTechies crew, and includes over 80 pages of information on how to work with the principles in question. From page 1 of the E-Book:

### Credits Due

I’d like to give a huge thanks to our fellow Pablo-ite, [Sean Biefeld](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/seanbiefeld/default.aspx), for the hard work he put into the editing of this document. He spent a good deal of time ensuring the formatting of content was good to go. [Jason Meridth](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/default.aspx) and [Joe Ocampo](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/default.aspx) also need some props for getting the e-book posted so quickly. And give a shout-out to a Los Techies blogger the next time you see one for providing such a great compendium of SOLID information via the [March 2008 Pablo’s Topic Of The Month](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/03/07/pablo-s-topic-of-the-month-march-solid-principles.aspx), as well as the other SOLID contributions that made it into the site at later times.
