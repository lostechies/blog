I had a lot of fun giving my SOLID Principles presentation at the <a href="http://adnug.org" target="_blank">Austin .NET User Group</a> last night. It was a pleasure and an honor to be able to give back to the community that has supported me for so many years. 

I&#8217;d like to thank everyone that came out to see the presentation, for being such a great audience. There were a lot of great questions and comments and good discussion. I sincerely hope that I&#8217;ve inspired at least a few people to continue digging into the SOLID principles. 

As promised, <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/files/folders/derickbailey/default.aspx" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve posted my slides and the example code for download</a>.
