[TrackAbout, Inc](http://corp.trackabout.com/) – the company that I’ve been employed with for the last 5 months – is hiring another .NET developer. We’re a passionate bunch of people – on the technology and business side of things – building high value, high quality software for an international customer base with deliveries to our production environments on a 2 week schedule.

  * and did I mention 100% work from home? seriously… you know you want to. 
      * spend more time with the family 
      * wake up 1 minute before you start your work day and still be early 
      * yell at the neighborhood kids “HEY! Get off my LAWN!” 🙂 
  * and 100% work from home… i said that, right? no really… i know you want to… 

**Here’s some of the team / technology highlights from from** **the job ad****:**
