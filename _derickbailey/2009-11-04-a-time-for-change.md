Change comes in groups of three, right? Well, I have [a 4 week old baby girl](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derickbailey/archive/2009/10/08/the-ultimate-hello-world.aspx) (I can hardly believe she’s 4 weeks old already). That would be change #1.&#160; For change #2, I turned in my two week notice to [my current employer](http://www.mclaneat.com) on Monday.

Starting on November 16th, I’ll be joining up with fellow LosTechie, [Joey Beninghove](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joeydotnet/default.aspx), over at [TrackAbout.com](http://trackabout.com).&#160; I’m excited about the opportunity. There’s a great bunch of developers on that team and it should be a lot of fun and a significant challenge for me, at the same time.

&#160;

Now I just have to wait and see what change #3 is going to be…
