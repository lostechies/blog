There was some interesting discussion amongst LosTechies members recently, and one of the things that came out of it was a comment about LT members keeping the community informed on what they are doing in terms of side projects, community efforts, etc. Since I haven‚Äôt blogged about my side projects on LT recently (I‚Äôve been blogging about them on their own sites), I thought I would take a moment and talk about what I‚Äôm currently involved in. ‚Ä¶ i guess this is kind of a ‚Äústate of the derick‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat i‚Äôve been up too, recently‚Äù post. üôÇ

### Albacore: Dolphin-Safe Rake Tasks For .NET Systems

**Website:** <http://albacorebuild.net>

**Purpose:** make it stupidly easy to build .NET systems with Ruby and Rake, including good build-time configuration management practices, and some deployment capabilities.

My primary side project right now is a suite a rake tasks to help build .NET systems. I‚Äôve blogged about this on LT before, but it‚Äôs been a few months. Most of the blogging I do about this is over at the <http://albacorebuild.net> website. There‚Äôs a small, passionate community of contributors that have really helped to make this project great. If you‚Äôre looking for an alternative to XML in your build processes, you should at least look at Albacore. You can find more information at the main site, and you can find some of my original posts here, via my [Albacore tag](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derickbailey/archive/tags/Albacore/default.aspx). You can also see a lot of great community effort around the ‚Äònet by googling ‚Äòalbacore rake‚Äô or ‚Äòalbacore build‚Äô or some other variation of albacore, ruby, rake, etc. This project has been presented at a few user groups in the US and in Europe, has users all around the world ‚Äì from down here in Texas, all the way over to China, and seems to be growing in popularity every day.

### Waco Tech Lunch

**Website:** <http://wacotechlunch.net>

**Purpose:** a gathering of techies in the Waco, TX area for lunch and general talk / fun

I started the Waco Tech Lunch in January of this year as a way for me to get to know more of the technology enthusiasts and professionals here in Waco and the surrounding area. Since I work from home now, I don‚Äôt get to have a lot of face to face time with other techies. the WTL gives me that opportunity, provides a great way to meet new people, and generally gives me a higher level of happiness in living in Waco. The knowledge that yes, there are other techies in the Waco area is rather comforting, seeing that I spent my first 8 years of living in Waco, working in other towns (Dallas and Temple).

### Central Texas .NET User Group (CTXDNUG)

**Website:** <http://www.ctxdnug.net>

**Purpose:** provide a place for .NET devs in the Waco, Temple, and surrounding areas to learn about new and upcoming technologies, techniques and practices in the .NET development space.

I met [Dale Glaser](http://twitter.com/dglaser) through the Waco Tech Lunch a month or so ago, and he started talking about putting together the CTXDNUG. I was extremely happy to see him so passionate about this, as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wanted to do for a long time but never had the time get moving on. Dale has done a tremendous job of getting this up and running very quickly, and the first meeting was last Thursday with [Matt Hinze](http://twitter.com/mhinze) talking about IoC. There‚Äôs a great list of speakers already lined up for this user group, and I hope to see it continue to grow and prosper. While I don‚Äôt claim to be a leader in the CTXDNUG ‚Äì all of that credit goes to Dale ‚Äì I do feel like I am a part of the group and want to encourage other developers in the Waco / Temple area to attend!

### Speaking / Presenting

My speaking and presenting has taken a serious nose dive since my 2nd baby was born back in October. However, I‚Äôm not completely gone. 

[**#LSSC10**](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23lssc10)**:** I‚Äôm currently scheduled to speak at the upcoming [Lean Software Systems Consortium conference in Atlanta](http://atlanta2010.leanssc.org/). I have a [short blog post](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derickbailey/archive/2010/01/20/my-decoupling-workflow-presentation-was-accepted-for-lssc10.aspx) about my presentation and am currently working on rewriting the material (the slides and the code). I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to get a paper done for the conference papers by the deadline‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll see.

**CTXDNUG:** I‚Äôm planning on doing a presentation at CTXDNUG, but don‚Äôt know the month or topic, yet. I‚Äôm still trying to work out the schedule between my family and the already amazing line of speakers that Dale has lined up.

**Other:** I‚Äôm thinking about getting back into scheduling some talks for [ADNUG](http://adnug.org/) and other Austin events (not yet sure if I can do this year‚Äôs [Austin Code Camp](http://austin-codecamp-2010.eventbrite.com/)). These are just ideas at the moment, and subject to other scheduling needs with my family. Plus, the ADNUG team has already lined up some great speakers so I wouldn‚Äôt be doing a presentation for a while, anyways.

What topics would you like to see me talk about at any of these user groups or events?

&#160;

### Professional Writing

I‚Äôm no stranger to professional writing. I had several articles published on now defunct websites back in the dotCom era, but I haven‚Äôt done much since then‚Ä¶ until recently. 

I‚Äôve had one article published in [Code Magazine](http://www.code-magazine.com/): my [SOLID principles](http://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=1001061) presentation materials, turned into a half narrative / half principles discussion. I‚Äôve received a lot of positive feedback on this and am happy to have taken the time to do it.&#160; I‚Äôve also got another article in the works for Code Magazine on using ruby, rake and my Albacore project. I don‚Äôt yet have confirmation of which issue it will be in, though. Just gotta wait and see. 

I‚Äôm hoping to continue the professional writing efforts for various print and online publications, and am considering a few topics for books to write. I understand the effort involved in writing a book, though, so I‚Äôm not yet committing to this endeavor. What subjects would you like to see me write about more ‚Äì either on this blog, in magazine articles, or as books?

### Keeping Up With What‚Äôs Going On

Well, that list of things I‚Äôm involved in a little more than I thought it was when I started this post. üôÇ If you‚Äôd like to keep up with what I‚Äôm doing on a closer-to-realtime basis, be sure to subscribe to the [LosTechies RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/lostechies) or my [personal RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/DerickBailey) (fed from my LosTechies blog posts), and [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/derickbailey).
