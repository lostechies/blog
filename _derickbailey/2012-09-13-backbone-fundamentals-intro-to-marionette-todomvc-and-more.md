I&#8217;m very happy to announce that this week&#8217;s addition to Addy Osmani&#8217;s [Backbone Fundamentals book](http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/#marionette) is a chapter on Marionette!

I was lucky enough to be able to contribute a large portion of the chapter to the book, including a brief introduction to some of the benefits that Marionette provides for Backbone applications. There&#8217;s a discussion on the Marionette version of the TodoMVC application, the architecture that I used based on Marionette, and some links to additional implementations that use Marionette without any modules, and with RequireJS.

Here&#8217;s a couple of paragraphs from [the intro section of this chapter](http://addyosmani.github.com/backbone-fundamentals/#marionette):

> _As we&#8217;ve seen, Backbone provides a great set of building blocks for our JavaScript applications. It gives us the core constructs that are needed to build small to mid-sized apps, organize jQuery DOM events, or create single page apps that support mobile devices and large scale enterprise needs. But Backbone is not a complete framework. It&#8217;s a set of building blocks that leaves much of the application design, architecture and scalability to the developer, including memory management, view management and more._
> 
> _Backbone.Marionette (or just &#8220;Marionette&#8221;) provides many of the features that the non-trivial application developer needs, above what Backbone itself provides. It is a composite application library that aims to simplify the construction of large scale applications. It does this by providing a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in the applications that the creator, Derick Bailey, and many other contributors have been using to build Backbone apps._

## Other Marionette Happenings

In addition to the chapter in this book, there are a number of other things happening with Marionette. I finally have a couple of other core contributors that are helping to run things, and keeping things moving. There&#8217;s a new website in the works, a logo in the works, an IRC channel and a twitter account.
