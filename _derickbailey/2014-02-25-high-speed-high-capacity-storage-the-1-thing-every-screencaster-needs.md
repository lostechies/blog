**If there&#8217;s one thing every screencaster needs, it&#8217;s high speed, high capacity storage for raw materials.** I just finished up my 15th episode of [WatchMeCode](http://watchmecode.net) (and have recorded probably another 15 or 20 episodes other than those) &#8211; here&#8217;s the progress bar copying my raw materials over to my [Western Digital Thunderbolt Storage](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F0JXDCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00F0JXDCS&linkCode=as2&tag=signalleaf-20) device.

Yes, **that&#8217;s 52 GIGS of raw materia**l! And yes, **it transferred in less than 5 minutes**! Seriously, I&#8217;ve edited screencasts directly on this thunderbolt drive before, it&#8217;s that fast&#8230; well, it&#8217;s fast enough. I don&#8217;t really recommend doing that when you have access to an SSD, like my Macbook Pro Retina has&#8230; but I have done it, and it does work. Instead, I leave the raw materials for the episode that I&#8217;m currently editing on my internal SSD. Once I&#8217;m done, I transfer it over to the storage device for &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; storage! I also put virtual machines that I don&#8217;t currently need on this device, as well as photos and other things that just need storage.

But this brings up a question: **why do I need so much storage space, and how did my episode grow to over 50 gigs of raw material?!**

## Retina Display: File Size And Storage Killer

Normally I use an Apple Thunderbolt monitor. It&#8217;s an awesome monitor. But I record my screencasts on my Macbook Pro Retina. I do this because **I record in my closet**. It&#8217;s a large closet, full of clothing and **it gives me great sound**. So it&#8217;s worth hauling my computer in to my closet for this. But I don&#8217;t want to haul may monitor in there, too. So I just set up a TV tray and use my laptop directly, with the retina monitor.

The only problem is that **the retina monitor is 4x the resolution that I actually need**. When I record on the retina and add audio from my [Rode Podcaster](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JM46FY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000JM46FY&linkCode=as2&tag=signalleaf-20)<img style="border: none !important;margin: 0px !important" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=signalleaf-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000JM46FY" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, I end up with a raw ScreenFlow project of near 18 gigs! It&#8217;s gigantic! I always end up with multiple copies of the original, as well. I usually hold one as &#8220;original&#8221; and use this for the &#8220;OH, CRAP!&#8221; moments when I break something so badly that I can recover it in my editors. I also create a &#8220;preview&#8221; video for my screencasts, which creates yet another copy. By the time things are done, **I&#8217;ve usually got 3 and sometimes 4 copies of the original source**. It gets large, fast, but it&#8217;s the best way for me to record and work, I&#8217;ve found.

Instead of letting these copies eat up 52 gigs of space on my MBPr, though, I have [the Western Digital storage device](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F0JXDCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00F0JXDCS&linkCode=as2&tag=signalleaf-20). It&#8217;s a 4TB version, but there are 6 and 8 TB versions as well. It is well worth the money to have a good storage device, too. Keeping the raw materials on that device lets me keep all the files that I do need on my hard drive, without worry about space.
