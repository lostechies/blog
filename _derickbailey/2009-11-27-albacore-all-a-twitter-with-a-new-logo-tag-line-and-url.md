Thereâ€™s been a lot of fun things happening with [Albacore](http://albacorebuild.net) over the holiday weekend.

### The Discussion Group

First, there was the [Google Groups announcement](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derickbailey/archive/2009/11/24/albacore-come-join-the-discussion.aspx) to coordinate the community. Itâ€™s taken off fairly well with our first call for help, and an answer from [Steve](http://stevenharman.com/).

### The Albacore Website

Next, [Ben Hall](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/) was kind enough to register and host the new url: 

> #### [**http://albacorebuild.net**](http://albacorebuild.net) ****

Weâ€™ve got it set to point at the Albacore Github page, and I have some ideas of what we can do with thisâ€¦ itâ€™ll grow over time so be sure to keep that url in mind as the central location to find all things Albacore.

### The Albacore Twitter

Then thereâ€™s a new twitter account to keep the twitterverse up to date with all the latest and greatest happenings in Albacore.

### The Albacore Tag Line

Donâ€™t forget about the new tag line! Iâ€™m quite proud of this oneâ€¦ itâ€™s kinda dumb, but funny at the same time. ðŸ™‚

### The Albacore Logo

And last, but certainly not least for the weekend, is the new Albacore logo that incorporates the tag line. I managed to pull out my rusty old design skills and put together this little gem with the help of [InkScape](http://www.inkscape.org).</p>

As you can see, itâ€™s been a busy holiday weekend for the Albacore crew. Iâ€™m hoping that this is just the beginning of a good community building effort, and a lot of support and contributions for the project.
