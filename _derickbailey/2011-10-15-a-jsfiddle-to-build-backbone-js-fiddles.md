I&#8217;m tired of building JSFiddle environments every time I need to set one up for a blog post, to show some Backbone.js code. Soâ€¦ I built:

[a JSFiddle that has nothing but the JavaScript libraries that I use for my Backbone.js Fiddles](http://jsfiddle.net/derickbailey/9cvVv/)



Fork it, build your own Backbone.js app, and share with the world. This should save me 20+ minutes for my blog posts that need a JSFiddle w/ Backbone.
