So, it turns out EmberJS has better documentation than I thought:

<http://ember-docs.herokuapp.com/>

It&#8217;s still not &#8220;complete&#8221; but it&#8217;s a giant leap forward compared to what little documentation I was able to find on EmberJS.com and the Github project. The real problem, then, is that this site is impossible to find unless you know it&#8217;s there. EmberJS.com doesn&#8217;t link it, from what I can see.
