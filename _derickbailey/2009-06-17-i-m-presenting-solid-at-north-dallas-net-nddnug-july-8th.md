On Wednesday, July 8th, I’m scheduled to give my SOLID presentation at [NDDNUG](http://northdallas.net/), up in Plano, TX. I don’t know if anyone up there remembers me, but NDDNUG was the first user group that I ever went to. I worked in Richardson, TX, for more than 4 years, just off Collins & 75, half a block away from [NerdBooks](http://www.nerdbooks.com/). I’m excited to be able to return to my old stomping ground and do a presentation in front of the first professional software developer group that I was a part of, 6+ years ago!

### The Presentation Materials

If anyone is interested in obtaining the slide deck and code for this presentation, I recently updated the .zip package in my media section, with the latest version of the slides.

### The Presentation Abstract

Almost every professional software developer understands the academic definitions of Coupling, Cohesion, and Encapsulation. However, many of us do not understand how to actually achieve Low Coupling, High Cohesion, and strong Encapsulation, as prescribed. Fortunately, there are a set of stepping stones that we can use to reach these end goals, giving us a clear cut path to software that is easier to read, easier to understand, and easier to change. This presentation will define not only the three object oriented goals, but also the five S.O.L.I.D. principle that lead us there, while walking through a sample application.
