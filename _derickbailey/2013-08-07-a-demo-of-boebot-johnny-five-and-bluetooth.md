I recently purchased and assembled a [BoE Bot kit for Arduino](http://www.parallax.com/tabid/768/ProductID/820/Default.aspx). It&#8217;s a product from [Parallax](http://www.parallax.com/), but I purchased mine through [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11494) (my personal go-to site for Arduino and related stuff).

After getting it assembled and calibrated, I started hacking away at some [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five) code to make it do what I wanted. In the process, I built a small library for myself to use, to drive the robot, [BoEBot.js](https://github.com/derickbailey/boebotjs). It&#8217;s a very early stage of code, with plenty of things it doesn&#8217;t do right, but it let me put together a quick demo video to show off the configuration and setup that I have in place.

## More Information: A Potential Book

If you&#8217;d like to know more about building Arduino projects, including some of the awesome things you can do with the &#8220;Board of Education&#8221; from Parallax, all from the comfort of JavaScript, let me know. I&#8217;m putting together an outline of projects and information for an upcoming book, titled &#8220;[**Arduino: Hardware For JavaScripters**](https://leanpub.com/arduino-for-javascripters)&#8220;.

Of course you can get all the information you need from other sources, at this point. Just follow the links from the this post. 

In this book, I&#8217;ll cover not only how to control the bot, but also some pro-tips on configuration and assembly of the hardware &#8211; some things you&#8217;ll want to keep in mind so that it&#8217;s easier to calibrate the servo motors, for example. And like most projects in the book, I&#8217;ll cover this material with both JavaScript and Arduino C.



So if you&#8217;re interested, head over to [the Leanpub.com page](https://leanpub.com/arduino-for-javascripters) and register your interest with the book. The more I hear from interested readers, the more likely it is that I&#8217;ll write and publish the book.
