Last weekend, I gave a presentation on HTML5 PushState using PushState, at Pablo&#8217;s Fiesta (I know, I know… a presentation at an open spaces conf. ya. :P) and David Ohara was kind enough to record it and upload it to Vimeo. So, here it is… consider this part 3 of my [2 part](https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/26/seo-and-accessibility-with-html5-pushstate-part-1-introducing-pushstate/) [series on pushstate](https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/26/seo-and-accessibility-with-html5-pushstate-part-2-progressive-enhancement-with-backbone-js/).



[Derick Bailey on HTML5 PushState](http://vimeo.com/30100462) from [David O&#8217;Hara](http://vimeo.com/user8794814) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

It&#8217;s a fairly short talk, actually &#8211; only about 30 minutes of content directly related to PushState. After that, the audience starts asking about Backbone.js in general so I answer some questions about the router and implementing things in Backbone.
