Hola and (Insert standard &#8220;hello world&#8221; content, here). 

Some of you may know me from my previous blogging effort over at AvocadoSoftware.com, or my more recent efforts at <a href="http://derickbailey.com" target="_blank">DerickBailey.com</a>. I&#8217;ll be continuing to post over at DerickBailey.com, where you can find my personal RSS feed, but will also be contributing my thoughts and ramblings to the Los Techies community now (once I figure out how to do cross-posting, anyway).

A huge thanks to Joe, Chad, and everyone else over here at Los Techies for thinking that I have something valuable to say and add to the community!

And per the &#8220;<a href="http://lostechies.com/blogs/evan_hoff/archive/2007/10/22/joining-los-techies.aspx" target="_blank">Los Techies N00B Ritual and Tattoo</a>&#8221; requirement. Here&#8217;s my &#8220;they&#8217;re both full of crap&#8221; tattoo. ðŸ™‚
