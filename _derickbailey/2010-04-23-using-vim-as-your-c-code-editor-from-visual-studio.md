No, not through [ViEmu](http://www.viemu.com/) or [VsVim](http://github.com/jaredpar/VsVim)‚Ä¶ I mean, actual honest to goodness [Vim](http://vim.org). 

I‚Äôve been working with Ruby for a not quite a year now (though, not much recently) and in that time I‚Äôve tried a lot of editors and IDEs for ruby on Windows ‚Äì including the Resharper-like RubyMine from JetBrains. RubyMine is a very powerful IDE with a lot of great refactoring tools built into it, etc. ‚Ä¶ but after all my experiments with the various ruby editors I find that the only thing I want is a good syntax highlighter and tree navigation. There are dozens of free editors out there that have this and a bunch of paid-for apps that also provide this in very convenient ways, including Vim with it‚Äôs many plugins.

Looking at my use of C#, though, I find myself constantly wanting Resharper to be around. Honestly, I think Resharper has made me a lazy developer with C# ‚Äì and that‚Äôs probably a good thing in the world of C# with all of it‚Äôs syntax ceremony, etc. But I keep wondering to myself what would happen if I didn‚Äôt have that crutch to lean on and I went down to barebones Vim to do my C# coding.

### Add Vim To Visual Studio‚Äôs Open With Option

I realize that I still want visual studio around for certain things, so I am not going to completely abandon it ‚Ä¶ yet‚Ä¶ but I decided to do an experiment today and see what I could get away with and get away from, in my C# coding. I added gVim (the Windows Vim port) to my Visual Studio ‚ÄúOpen With‚Äù options for my C# code files. 

In Visual Studio 2008 (I‚Äôm currently doing Windows Mobile development, so I‚Äôm stuck with VS2008 for now) right click on a .cs file and selected Open With. You‚Äôll get a nice dialog listing all the different options for .cs files. Click the Add button to add a new one.

Browse to your gvim.exe location with the ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù button and select it. The Friendly name will be populated automatically. Then hit OK. You‚Äôll end up with Vi Improved in your Open With dialog box.

Now if you‚Äôre really brave, set this as the default. üôÇ If you don‚Äôt want to set it as default (I don‚Äôt blame you‚Ä¶ at least not until I‚Äôm more comfortable with this) you can just right click on a file and select Open With whenever you want to use Vim.

### Stumble, Trip, Stumble, Trip

Of course I find myself stumbling and tripping and falling all over myself and vim when I‚Äôm editing C# files. I‚Äôm so used to Resharper being there to do everything for me that I find it very difficult to be productive. I don‚Äôt event have a good set of vim files for color coding my C# at this point, so that makes it even more ‚Äòfun‚Äô. But I‚Äôm determined to see what I can do with Vim as my actual code editor‚Ä¶ to face the problems that I run into and find solutions for them‚Ä¶ to see if I actually need a micro-code generator like Resharper and find out if it really is just a crutch or if it is one of those necessary items because of the style of development that I engage in with C#. I‚Äôm hoping that I can find Vim plugins and syntax highlighting files that will help me solve the various problems that I run into, and that I can slowly replace more and more of my Resharper usage with Vim usage.

I don‚Äôt expect to give up Visual Studio any time soon, and I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôll ever be able to get away from it completely‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôll see. I am hoping that over time I‚Äôll rely less and less on Visual Studio and Resharper or at least come away from this experience with a better understanding of why I need them (if that‚Äôs the case). 

‚Ä¶ and now I‚Äôm off to find a good set of C# vim files.
