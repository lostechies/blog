Tekpub release [their series on Knockout.js](http://tekpub.com/productions/knockout) recently and I was fortunate enough to make a guest appearance! Now I know you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;why would Derick make an appearance in a Knockout series?!&#8221; But don&#8217;t worry &#8211; I&#8217;m not there to sell anyone on Backbone. Rob asked me to pitch in a little bit of code review and suggestions for how to take the code to the next level. I was happy to help, and I think the video (and the entire series) turned out amazingly well, as Tekpub always does.

From the Tekpub site, on the Knockout series:

> In this series we take a look at KnockoutJS from Steven Sanderson &#8211; building out an Order Management page to be a bit more user-friendly and inviting. Along the way we pay attention to good javascript habits: unobtrusive design, namespacing, clean separation, and making sure our ViewModel doesn&#8217;t do too much.

And on the last episode, where I make an appearance:

> We&#8217;ve taken a first pass at cleaning up our code, but nothing beats a code review with a senior dev. For this, Rob asks his friend Derick Bailey (a Backbone/Javascript developer) to review what he&#8217;s done so far. Derick suggests many improvements &#8211; which make the code much more readable. This is the final episode in the series.
