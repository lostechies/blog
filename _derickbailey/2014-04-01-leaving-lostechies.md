You may (or may not) have noticed that I haven&#8217;t posted here in a few weeks. There&#8217;s a reason for that&#8230; an era is coming to an end. **It&#8217;s time for me to move on from LosTechies** &#8211; a community that will always be near and dear to me. But as time goes on and life gives me new opportunities, I find myself in situations where **i want to do things that would go against the nature of the LosTechies community.** So it&#8217;s with these new ideas, new opportunities and new goals in mind, that **I bid farewell to the community that has helped me grow so much in the last 6 years**. 

## **But I&#8217;m far from done and over, mind you**

**I&#8217;m not abandoning blogging or the internet or anything crazy like that.** I am simply moving my primary blog over to [DerickBailey.com](http://derickbailey.com), where I have already begun blogging. I&#8217;m also taking this opportunity to move away from FeedBurner and try out FeedBlitz instead. This is something I&#8217;ve wanted to try for a while now, and this seemed like a good opportunity. 

So if you want to keep up with what I&#8217;m doing, continue to receive all the blog content that you know and love, **I recommend doing 2 things:**

  1. Head over to [DerickBailey.com](http://derickbailey.com) and subscribe to [my new RSS feed](http://feeds.feedblitz.com/derickbailey) (the one you&#8217;ve been subscribed to is now stale and won&#8217;t be updated again)
  2. <a href="https://www.getdrip.com/forms/5764052/submissions/new" target="_blank"><strong>Join my mailing list</strong></a>, where you&#8217;ll learn the secrets that I don&#8217;t share on my blog

I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing you at my new address on the web!
