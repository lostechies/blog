I saw the phrase &#8220;I&#8217;m paid to write software, not tests&#8221; recently, and it drove me up the wall crazy. I hate this phrase and all of the misleading, misinformation that it spews. This phrase is not only false, it&#8217;s fallacy. To suggest that we pit software against tests in terms of what we are paid to doâ€¦ there is no logical path for this dichotomy to exist.

We, as software developers, are not paid to write software or tests. We&#8217;re paid to solve problems and provide solutions that either reduce cost or increase value/revenue for a business. We happen to do it through software, and writing tests is part of [writing sustainable software](https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2009/01/31/favor-defect-prevention-over-quality-inspection-and-correction/).

**Consistent And Reliable**

I&#8217;m paid to solve problems consistently and reliably, and either implement the solutions through software or recommend a solution that doesn&#8217;t involve software. If I solve a problem once, but the solution breaks or is not repeatable after that one time, I have not done my job. If I solve a problem 100 times, add more code to try and solve a second problem and end up breaking the first solution, I have not done my job. My job is done when I can consistently and reliably solve the problem in a manner that either adds value or reduces cost.

**Mechanics**

Writing software is the simple, mechanical part of what we do. A machine can write software. In fact, that is what we end up doing most of the time &#8211; a compiler or interpreter is used to take abstraction and code that a human can understand and produce the software that the computer can understand.

**Go, Solve Problems**

You are not paid to write software or tests. You are paid to solve problems and you happen to do it through software (**and** tests).
