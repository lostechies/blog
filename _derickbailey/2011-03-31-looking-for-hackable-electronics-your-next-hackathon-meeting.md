Hey dumpster-diving electronics hacking people!

I wish I had the time to be a hardware mod&#8217;er / tinkerer / hacker &#8230; I&#8217;ve got enough old junk around my house to do it, but no time to spend on it. I know there are some of you out there, though, who love to do it and have the time. So, I thought I would spread the word about ThinkGeek&#8217;s latest idea:

From <http://thinkgeek.com/blog/2011/03/take-these-broken-things.html>

> **We have a problem.** And it&#8217;s growing at a rate proportional to our return pile.
> 
> We can&#8217;t, _in good conscience_, resell damaged electronics. And we can&#8217;t donate them to charity&#8211;the saddest kid in the world is one with a handheld video game that won&#8217;t turn on. Garbage, then? Not good for the environment.
> 
> Luckily for us, there&#8217;s an entire class of scavengers out there ready to pick the bones of our helicopters, keyboards, and interactive t-shirts: **hackers, makers, and crafty techy types**.
> 
> Whether it&#8217;s in a school&#8217;s technology lab, or a [FIRST Robotics team](http://www.usfirst.org/), or your neighborhood [hackerspace](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces), we&#8217;re betting somebody out there would enjoy getting a box of broken stuff from us every couple of months&#8211;and then use the parts and pieces **for good, not evil**.
> 
> While we can&#8217;t promise anything right now, we&#8217;re very seriously considering setting up such a subscription and we&#8217;re ready to gather contact information from those who are interested. **Sign up below and we&#8217;ll see where this goes!**

This looks like an awesome idea. Props to think geek for this, on many levels: recycling, saving the environment (instead of throwing things out), not being jerks and re-selling broken stuff, and supporting the hardware-hacker community!
