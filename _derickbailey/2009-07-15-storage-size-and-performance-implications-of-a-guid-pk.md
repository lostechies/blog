I sent the same [Guid vs. Int. vs BigInt](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derickbailey/archive/2009/07/14/database-id-int-vs-bigint-vs-guid.aspx) question to a group of coworkers yesterday. One of the responses I got was from a DBA, and I thought was worth repeating for the world to hear. Keep in mind that these represent the opinions and research of my coworker, not me. Whether I agree with him or not, is not the point of posting his response for the world to see.

Just as with most other things, there is no one correct answer.&#160; I am a proponent of natural keys when they make sense.&#160; Occasionally, we find that the natural key of an relation becomes cumbersome to deal with on a regular basis and we opt to utilize a surrogate key.&#160; Surrogate key usage is a different discussion all together regardless of the data type chosen to represent it.

As far as size and scalabilityâ€¦ in SQL Server, an int is 4 Bytes and can hold roughly 2 Billion positive unique numbers, bigint is 8 Bytes and can hold about&#160; 9.2 Quintillion (9,223,372,036,854,775,808) positive unique records.

GUIDs are typically 16 Bytes and can store 3.4 X10^38 unique values.&#160; 

There are several arguments for the use of&#160; GUID in databases utilized by applications that we write.&#160; 

  1. You can generate the pk in code.
  2. You donâ€™t have to execute and additional DB call to retrieve the key, post insert.
  3. Should you need to merge databases between different environments, the keys ***should*** not collide
  1. This assumes that some other natural key, represented by a unique index, is not violated.

  4. You all can read the rest of the reasons in [[the article linked](http://nhforge.org/blogs/nhibernate/archive/2009/03/20/nhibernate-poid-generators-revealed.aspx) at NHForge].

That having been said, if you were to have a relation with 500 million records. The following would be true.

You can see that there is a significant different in the amount of space required to store a GUID vs Int or BigInt.&#160; Although disk-space is cheap,&#160; ultimately, that equates to physical contiguous blocks on a hard drive platter (until we all move to SS HDDâ€™s) that have to be physically read or skipped during a seek event.&#160; This can have a negative impact on database seeks that require a table scan.&#160; Once the data is located, the GUID also consumes significantly more memory (RAM) during the retrievalâ€¦

If you are doing exact (indexed) fetches via the primary key (OLTP transactions), most of those arguments donâ€™t hold water.&#160; Most of what we do **is** OLTP.&#160; In an OLAP environment, I strongly recommend the use of natural keys and the smallest data type available to store the data, for the reasons listed above.&#160; When you truly have a relation with 260 million rows and that needs to be joined with a relation containing 500 million rows, an 8-12 byte increase on one of the columns used in the join (on each row) can bring even a hefty db server to its knees.&#160; The likelihood of this happening in one of our OLTP systems is about the same as the likelihood that a GUID will be duplicated. ðŸ™‚

One last thought, db indexes on integer data types are EXTREMELY EFFICIENT, and extremely small.&#160; I honestly donâ€™t know the size difference, but I do know that an index on a GUID is inherently more complex.

Long story short.&#160; Use your brain when you architect these things.&#160; When it makes sense to use a GUID for application architectural reasons, by all means, use them.&#160; However, be aware that the natural keys still exist, and your GUID may need to be done away with in a migration to a large aggregate OLAP reporting system.

Now, if I could only convince him (and the rest of my company) to blog about these things, on their own! ðŸ™‚
