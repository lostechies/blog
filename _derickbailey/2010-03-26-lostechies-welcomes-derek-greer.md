A former coworker and good friend of mine, Derek Greer, has joined up with the LosTechies crew. He previously lived and worked in the Austin, TX area where I had the good fortune to meet him and hire him on at my previous job. Heâ€™s now living in Tennessee, near Nashvilleâ€¦ but weâ€™ll forgive him for moving so far away. ðŸ™‚ 

Iâ€™m happy as heck to see Derek joining up with the LT crew, as I know his passion for software craftsmanship, learning, engaging in discussion and all-around fun-guy attitude will be a welcome addition. You can read his prior blog over at <http://aspiringcraftsman.com> where heâ€™s got some tremendously good information on a wide variety of subjects.

So, stop by [his new home](http://derekgreer.lostechies.com) and say hi!
