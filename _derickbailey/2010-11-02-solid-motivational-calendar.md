The LosTechies crew and I were never able to get a calendar or t-shirts or anything else made for the [SOLID Motivational Posters](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derickbailey/archive/2009/02/11/solid-development-principles-in-motivational-pictures.aspx) that I put together a long time ago. But [Steve Smith](http://stevesmithblog.com/) ([@ardalis](http://twitter.com/ardalis)) and the [NimblePros](http://nimblepros.com) crew stepped up and put together a calendar of motivational posters, including many other principles:

(actual images from [the calendar](http://nimblepros.com/products/software-craftsmanship-2011-calendar.aspx))

Looks like a pretty good collection of principles and pictures, including SOLID. Nicely done NimblePros team! Iâ€™m happy to see that someone took the time to do this.
