[<img style="border-right-width: 0px;margin: 0px 5px 5px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" align="left" src="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/files/2011/03/image_75C77126.png" width="316" height="210" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/djs1021/3906751541/) There’s been a whirlwind of activity around the [Albacore rake tasks](http://github.com/derickbailey/Albacore) recently. Steve Harman has started [using it at VersionOne](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2009/11/23/omg-better-rake-for-.net.aspx). [Ben Hall](http://blog.benhall.me.uk/) has been contributing some great patches and tasks. My friends and former coworkers at my previous job are using it on a number of projects, and there’s still others who are [looking at contributing](http://github.com/derickbailey/Albacore/issues#issue/28) and using the framework. I’m really excited about the possibilities and directions that this is heading. 

With all this in mind, keeping everyone informed on what’s going on is becoming more and more challenging, and more and more important. So, I decided to put together a mailing list for the framework over at Google Groups. 

Come join the discussion! Get involved! Ask your questions, talk about issues that you’ve found, submit ideas, and send in some patches while your at it.
