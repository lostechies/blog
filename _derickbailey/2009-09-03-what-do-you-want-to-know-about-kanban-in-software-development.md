I asked this question [via Twitter](http://twitter.com/derickbailey/statuses/3734878894) a few minutes ago, and wanted to ask the non-twittering inter-web-o-blog-reading public:

> **if I were to do an Intro To Kanban presentation for your team/company/local-user-group, what questions would you want answered?**

Let me know what you would like to have answered, and I’ll see what the common threads are. The resulting presentation material will be made available via my GitHub account, and I’ll likely end up answering some of the questions via blog posts, too.
