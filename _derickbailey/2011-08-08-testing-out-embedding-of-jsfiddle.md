This is mostly just a test to see if I can get a JSFiddle embedded into my blog post.



The fiddle is a small backbone app that I&#8217;ve been playing with, to try out some different architectural ideas. It&#8217;s nothing really impressive from a functional perspective.

I think the code is quite nice, though. I&#8217;m especially fond of the way I set up an AppView to control the transitions between views, when routing between the list, add and edit.
