In case you&#8217;ve missed my tweets about this, I&#8217;ve done a few interviews on some podcasts recently.

## Herding Code: BackboneJS

[Herding Code Episode 133](http://herdingcode.com/?p=390)

From the site:

> _In this episode, the guys talk with Derick Bailey (consultant and founder of watchmecode.net, where he sells JavaScript themed screen casts) about Backbone.js, which is a popular JavaScript framework._

My audio is a bit choppy, unfortunately &#8211; I think I had some microphone problems and a lot of &#8220;uh&#8221; and &#8220;um&#8221; that they had to edit out. Sorry about that. But I keep hearing about how great the episode is, and how much people have learned from itâ€¦ so, check it out! ðŸ™‚

## .NetRocks! JavaScript In General

[.NET Rocks! Episode 743](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=743)

From the site:

> _Carl and Richard talk to Derick Bailey about Javascript in general and Javascript frameworks specifically. The conversation starts out with a discussion about the state of Javascript in general, discussing the recent popularity of node.js. Derick then digs into BackboneJS and how it works with jQuery to keep things far more organized. He also discusses utilizing MongoDB and RavenDB from Javascript using JSON as the communication path. The discussion ends with some looks at the future of Javascript in Windows 8 and the next generation of browsers._

So, yeahâ€¦ I had to record this one over the phone, unfortunately. There were problems getting Skype working, and I tried to record it on my end, but it didn&#8217;t come out quite as well as it should have, so I &#8220;phoned it in&#8221;! LOL ðŸ˜›

I had a lot of fun with this one, too. I enjoyed being able to explore a lot of different aspects of the growth in JavaScript in recent years. Give it a listen! I&#8217;m really happy with the way it came out.

## More To Come!

I have at least one more in-the-works invitation for a podcast, as well. And if you&#8217;re interested in having me on a show, let me know! You can find [my contact information](http://mutedsolutions.com/contact) on my company website.
