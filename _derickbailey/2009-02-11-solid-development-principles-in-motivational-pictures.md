I found the <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/motivator.php" target="_blank">Motivator</a> this morning. It lets you create your own motivational pictures. So, here&rsquo;s my first run at creating the <a href="/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/03/07/pablo-s-topic-of-the-month-march-solid-principles.aspx" target="_blank">SOLID software development principles</a> in motivational picture form. I &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; the images from google image search results. I hope you find them to be as fun as I do! I have them all hanging up in my team room, already. ðŸ™‚

(**Update:** I never expected the response to this post to be so great! <span style="text-decoration: line-through">There have been many inquiries about prints, high res versions, etc. As I said in the comments below, the source pictures that are linked via the thumbnails are all I have. There does appear to be some effort to produce high res versions, though. See the comments for more info!</span>)

&nbsp;

**Update:** <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Due to the continuous request for prints, posters, calendars, etc, we (LosTechies) are looking into what it would take to get these turned into high quality prints of various types. I don&rsquo;t have any detail yet, but I am hoping to have some good info on this, fairly soon.</span>

&nbsp;

**Update:** Steve Smith and the NimblePros crew have created their own version of the posters, along with other principles, in a Calendar for 2011. Go get yours, here: <http://nimblepros.com/products/software-craftsmanship-2011-calendar.aspx>

### SOLID

Software development is not a Jenga game.

(This one was created by <a href="http://blog.fohjin.com/" target="_blank">Mark Nijhof</a>&rsquo;s. He posted it via <a href="http://twitter.com/marknijhof" target="_blank">twitter</a> and I&rsquo;m borrowing it for my own collection.)

&nbsp;

### Single Responsibility Principle

Just because you can, doesn&rsquo;t mean you should.

(**Update:** I knew I had seen this Swiss Army knife in a Single Responsibility post before. Gabriel <a href="/blogs/gabrielschenker/archive/2009/01/21/real-swiss-don-t-need-srp-do-they.aspx" target="_blank">reminded me where</a>.)

&nbsp;

### Open Closed Principle

Open chest surgery is not needed when putting on a coat.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but needs batteries &ndash; you probably have the wrong abstraction

### Interface Segregation Principle

You want me to plug this in, where?

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Would you solder a lamp directly to the electrical wiring in a wall?
