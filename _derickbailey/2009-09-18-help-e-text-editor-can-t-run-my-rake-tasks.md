I downloaded the E-Text Editor to work with my ruby / rake stuff, because it’s a great editor and because it supports all of the TextMate bundles. The idea is that I should be able to run all of my Rake tasks and RSpec tests directly from E. However, I can’t seem to run my rake tasks.

I’ve got Cygwin installed (am new to this… don’t really know much about it). I’ve got the Ruby one-click installer installed (I’ve been using this for several months now). And I’ve got the Ruby textmate bundle installed into E(updated it from the E bundles menu).

Whenever I try to run a rake task, though, I get this error:

 <img style="border-bottom: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-right: 0px" border="0" alt="c:Rubybinruby.exe: No such file or directory -- C:UsersderickbAppDataRoamingeInstalledBundlesRuby.tmbundleSupportRakeMaterake_mate.rb (LoadError) " src="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/files/2011/03/image_6E8E2ABE.png" width="700" height="544" />

I have checked for the file that it says it can’t find. The file does exist. Does anyone have any clue what this error means and how to fix it? My google searches on this have been returning nothing.
