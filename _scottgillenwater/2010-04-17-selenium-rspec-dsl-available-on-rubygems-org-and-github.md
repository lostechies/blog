I have released my first version of selenium-rspec-dsl on RubyGems.org and on GitHub.&nbsp; It that makes selenium testing easier to create, maintainable, and scalable.&nbsp; 

Features:

  * Runs on Ruby Selenium-Client 1.2.17, and Selenium-Grid 1.0.4 with Selenium RC 1.0.3
  * Rake Multi-Processing Tests to speed execution of tests utilizing Selenium-Grid
  * Element Level Classes that eliminates the use of adding sleeps to tests/specs, multi-window support, and elements that work with ExtJs, JQuery, GWT objects.
  * Modified Aggregate Report generator that displays number of specs run, examples runs, and Total and Cumulative Test Times.

Coming Soon &#8211; Documentation on how to use DSL.
