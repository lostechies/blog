Read this post! I&#8217;m challenging you to make a difference.

I was part of the Funding Open Source Projects discussion at the ALT.NET conference. Oren has a good summary which can be found [here](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/04/21/Funding-Open-Source-Projects.aspx "Funding Open Source Projects"). He mentions that donations sound good, but really don&#8217;t work. I think that&#8217;s a shame. I have these thoughts that we as a community could do some really cool things if we work together get things done.

I want to try a little experiment using the current buzz around the ALT.NET conference. I challenge 5+ volunteers to donate $$ to their favorite OS project and say that they did so on their blogs and then challenge 5+ more volunteers to do the same. If you don&#8217;t have a blog, then post a comment here saying you donated.

I donated to [Oren&#8217;s Open Source efforts.](http://www.ayende.com/donations.aspx "Donations")

Don&#8217;t put it off. Do it now. Blog it. Tweet it. Spread the word! Donate!

UPDATE: Donating time to Open Source Projects counts too!

UPDATE: One thing that $$ could help out with is hiring someone to do documentation. Oren said that working on open source projects is his hobby and that&#8217;s why he does it. He also said that he doesn&#8217;t like to do documentation and that is not his hobby. I don&#8217;t know any developers that like to do documentation.
