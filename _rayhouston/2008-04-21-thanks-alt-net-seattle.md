The ALT.NET conference wrapped up yesterday afternoon. I wanted to say thanks to all the volunteers, organizers, and sponsors. Thanks to all the other participants who made up the conference. I got to meet a lot of folks who I had only previously known online and I got to be involved in many interesting conversations. I even got to see some snow coming down. It was a very productive conference.

I wanted to give a special thanks to all the Microsoft folks that attended the conference. Those guys get beat up a lot sometimes and I am very impressed by how well they respond to criticism. My hat goes off to those guys for taking the criticism and responding in positive ways. I have a lot of respect for those folks.

Software is hard. Perhaps we will eventually evolve software development into something that&#8217;s not hard. Perhaps there will be some completely new radical idea which makes the software development we do today become part of history books. Until then it&#8217;s all really about striving to suck less. It seems that whatever gets labeled as the right way of doing things is really just a way to suck less.

So here&#8217;s my definition of ALT.NET &#8211; People helping each other to suck less.
