I&#8217;m happy to announce that Gabriel Schenker has accepted an invitation to join Los Techies. You may know Gabriel as the man behind the [NHibernate FAQ Blog](http://blogs.hibernatingrhinos.com/nhibernate/Default.aspx) or contributor to many of the software related community lists. He is an expert in [didactics](http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didactics&ei=v91oSfGDIJSaNZKqzZ4H&usg=AFQjCNG3vYp1hxeIf7AK8ADaXhZPu3774g) and methodology. He is very passionate about software development and the software community.
