The folks at [LosTechies](https://lostechies.com/) invited me to join their blogging team. I&#8217;m not sure why they would want to dilute their blogging talent pool by having me, but I&#8217;m honored and I pledge to contribute to the best of my ability. This means that I&#8217;m going to have to increase my posting frequency which I&#8217;ve been planning on doing for awhile. Being part of the team is a nice motivator, so I hope they don&#8217;t kick me off after they get to know me. ðŸ˜‰

If you&#8217;ve subscribed using my [FeedBurner RSS](https://feeds.feedburner.com/RayHoustonBlog), then you don&#8217;t have to update anything. My new blog URL is <https://lostechies.com/blogs/rhouston>.&nbsp; Many thanks to LosTechies for having me.
