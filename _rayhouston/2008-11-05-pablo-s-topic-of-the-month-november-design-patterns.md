### Pablo&#8217;s Topic of the Month &#8211; November: Design Patterns

[<img border="0" align="right" width="240" src="//lostechies.com/rayhouston/files/2011/03/image_thumb.png" alt="image" height="240" style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px;border-right-width: 0px" />](//lostechies.com/rayhouston/files/2011/03/image_5.png) Back in April, we announced we would be doing a PTOM on Design Patterns. It turned out that April was a busy month for all of us and we didn&#8217;t live up to our announcement.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re going to claim it as a sad April fools joke. During the course of this month we will revisit our previous topic with the exception that the patterns will not just be patterns from [&#8216;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&#8217; (Addison-Wesley. ISBN 0-201-63361-2)](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1207103933&sr=11-1) , but from various sources which we believe are relevant to the types of programs being written today.

### What is a Design Pattern?

A Design Pattern is exactly what it sounds like. It&#8217;s a design that can be applied over and over again, forming a pattern. The Wikipedia [page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) for Design Patterns describes one as

> a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in [software design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design). A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into [code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_%28computer_programming%29). It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

By using Design Patterns, we can better standardize our designs makes them easier to understand.&nbsp; Design Patterns give us a common vocabulary in which to use in communicating software designs. Without them, we would have a difficult time in explaining and documenting our ideas.
