After seeing this book referenced in another book I&#8217;m currently reading and also seeing it on the SEI&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/architecture/essential_collection.html" target="_blank">Essential Collection</a>, I thought it would be a good idea to pick up a copy.&nbsp; The 3rd edition is the most recent printing (1996), but the original was published back in 1969.&nbsp; If you can find a book on technical topics that&#8217;s as old as this one, you know you&#8217;ve found a good one.

**The Artificial?&nbsp; You mean AI?**

No, not even close.&nbsp; The first chapter does a great job describing the difference between the natural and the artificial.&nbsp; In short, anything that&#8217;s man made is artificial.&nbsp; That includes everything from software to skyscrapers.&nbsp; The obvious conclusion reached at the start of the book, is that our classical sciences only deal with things _as they are_.&nbsp; Given an existing structure, for example, the classical sciences allow us to reason about the various properties of the item in question.&nbsp; What they don&#8217;t tell us directly, is how to design something artificial, from scratch, to best meet the needs of the intended user, consumer, etc.&nbsp; From this point, the author lays out a very compelling mini-curriculum on the subject of design.

Overall, I found this book to be very thought provoking.&nbsp; It will definitely be one of those books I reread down the road.

A couple of other interesting facts about this particular book:

  * The author is a professor of computer science and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University and the 1978 Nobel Laureate in Economics
  * It was published by MIT Press

While I highly recommend this book, if you put a couple others under your belt first, the book will jump out considerably more.&nbsp; In particular, start with a good study on the topic of Quality Attributes first.&nbsp; You will quickly make the connections if you do.&nbsp; I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Architecture-Practice-2nd-Engineering/dp/0321154959" target="_blank">this one</a>.
