I managed to miss the acquisition in February, but this is really cool nonetheless.&nbsp; Sun Microsystems paid $1 Billion for the commercial support vendor behind MySql (yes, the open source database).

What was the&nbsp; reaction?

> Sun Microsystems&#8217;s acquisition of MySQL was &#8220;a billion-dollar vote for the LAMP stack.&#8221; That&#8217;s how former MySQL CEO Marten Mickos, now senior vice president in Sun&#8217;s Database Group, characterized the deal during his keynote speech at this week&#8217;s MySQL Conference and Expo.

A billion dollar vote?&nbsp; Daaang.

And what did Sun&#8217;s CEO have to say?

> Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz was on hand to confront critics of the merger. &#8220;Do you all want to know our secret agenda?&#8221; Schwartz asked the crowd. &#8220;It&#8217;s to serve the [open source] community. Each one of those folks represents an opportunity for Sun.&#8221;

If embracing open source means standardizing on high quality ways of developing software, I wonder what the impact will be on the enterprises represented in the community.

They just might shift from competing on **being able to build software** (on time, on budget, etc) and instead focus on **building innovative software for their business**.&nbsp; The difference is subtle, but the results could be profound.
