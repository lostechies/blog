For those on my RSS feed, I&#8217;ve switched blog homes on the web.&nbsp; I switched the RSS feed in the background on you, so now that you are seeing this, you are fully switched over (there&#8217;s nothing to do on your part).

I did want to link back to the last group of posts I wrote though, just so the newer ones don&#8217;t get lost in the move.
