Over lunch today, I learned about one of the company&#8217;s recent acquisitions.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s the short of it:

  * The production system has between 6k-7k different Access databases (databases, not tables)
  * Since the app creates new databases on the fly, no one is sure which are production dbs

Don&#8217;t ever do that.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; And no, I couldn&#8217;t make this one up even if I tried. ðŸ˜‰
