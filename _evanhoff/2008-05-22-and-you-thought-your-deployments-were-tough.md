Did you know:

  * eBay deploys a new release every 2 weeks
  * They add roughly 100 KLOC per week to the codebase

That should be a little extra motivation to work on removing the waste and increasing the flow of getting your application out the door.&nbsp; If they can do it with a 6 million line codebase, why can&#8217;t you on your codebase (which is likely trivial in comparison).
