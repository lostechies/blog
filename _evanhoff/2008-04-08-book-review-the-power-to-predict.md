<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Predict-Businesses-Opportunities-Competition/dp/0071450149/" target="_blank">The Power to Predict</a> is one of a series of books I&#8217;m currently sloshing through on event-based programming.&nbsp; It&#8217;s author is none other than the CEO of Tibco, [Vivek Ranadive](http://www.tibco.com/company/leadership/bio_ranadive.jsp).&nbsp; Noticing that and the forward by <a href="http://news.van.fedex.com/frederickwsmith" target="_blank">Frederick Smith</a>, the FedEx CEO, it definitely caught my eye.

The book is loosely based on the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Event_Processing" target="_blank">Complex Event Processing</a>&nbsp;(CEP), a technique that&#8217;s an evolutionary step above <a href="http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs410/lectures/slides/event.ppt" target="_blank">Event Based Architecture</a> (EDA).&nbsp; The author&#8217;s earlier book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Now-Companies-Real-Time-Technology/dp/0071356843/" target="_blank">the Power of Now</a>, which I haven&#8217;t read yet, is apparently more about event-based architecture (or so I picked up from the book).

Generally speaking, the book appeals more towards the business oriented than the technical.&nbsp; You won&#8217;t find any code inside (not a bad thing), however, it was an interesting read to hear how real-time pattern recognition and reaction can be applied to so many industries (his examples included&nbsp;oil rig management, defense/military, telco, financial services, and health care).

While CEP is pretty far from being mainstream (in the&nbsp;MS ecosystem anyway), it&#8217;s definitely an interesting study.&nbsp; Given that industry heavies (such as Google and Amazon) have been applying this quite successfully for some time, I think it&#8217;s mostly a matter of time (and tooling) before it goes mainstream.

Overall, I did like the book, however, I would probably recommend you focus your energy elsewhere&#8211;especially if you are just trying to learn about EDA and CEP.&nbsp; This book has good content, but ultimately, it won&#8217;t help you make the paradigm shift in thinking that EDA represents.
