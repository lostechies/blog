> I couldn&#8217;t find any on google.

> I don&#8217;t have any problem with MS putting out frameworks, however, what ends up being construed from the frameworks that are written is that they are the &#8220;golden&#8221; Microsoft implementation (usually due to lack of knowledge).
> 
> Stored procedures are a good example. Probably everyone on this list has been in a shop where stored procedures were touted as the &#8220;Microsoft best practice&#8221;. If you weren&#8217;t using stored procedures for database access, it was the equivalent of trying to get the team to switch to perl (for instance). This plays heavily into the O/RM topic and even Microsoft got some blowback on this topic with the entity framework. Nearly everyone here knows the sproc myth is just dogmatic thinking. I would imagine that most of the &#8216;softies would agree with us (I&#8217;m speculating).
> 
> How do you change this? More guidance in the patterns and practices (maybe a microsoft.com article explaining benefits/examples of pragmatic database access without stored procs).
> 
> Here&#8217;s another huge pain in my side. Microsoft has created a set of tools which brings the barrier of entry down extremely low (not a bad thing in and of itself). In fact, they&#8217;ve even released the free hobbyist versions of Visual Studio to reduce the economic barrier. A side effect is that you are bringing many people who can just &#8220;wing it&#8221; in development, but who lack the knowledge/motivation/interest in learning the principles behind developing a clean code base (think OO). If I had to generalize, I would say it&#8217;s mostly a knowledge issue. All the developers I have worked with (including the ones who just picked it up as a hobby and started &#8220;winging it&#8221;&#8211;including myself), wanted to be good developers, but aren&#8217;t aware of that side of development. Basic principles are a huge gaping hole in the .NET community. I could probably find you a few dozen User Group leaders, RDs, etc who couldn&#8217;t name a single development principle. I know a few who think Pattern is a four letter word.
> 
> It might be a valid point to say that educating the .NET community is not the job of Microsoft, but the problem is that the barrier of entry is so low (again, not a bad thing) that it&#8217;s causing problems (and ultimately, an ALT.NET reaction). Microsoft has positioned itself as the end all for everything .NET (rightly so), but then it leaves this huge hole looming in it&#8217;s community of developers.
> 
> In short, patterns and practices could fundamentally change the .NET community (in a HUGE way), by doing a blitz on Principles and Patterns (and don&#8217;t make up your own)&#8211;more principles than anything at this point in time (that&#8217;s where we are at Today).
> 
> In fact, if you look closely, you will find that ALT.NET is really a conglomeration of Principles, Patterns & Practices. Don&#8217;t take this as offensive, but even the user stories floating around this mailing list are around building a type of CMS for aggregating P&P literature. It&#8217;s because principles are a huge gaping hole in the community (along with newer development methodologies and practices), and they are completely missing from P&P.

> It&#8217;s just compounded by the fact that those of us that take the time to learn the principles/patterns get shut down by dogmatic thinking (see sprocs above). If P&P led a &#8220;principles&#8221; assault, it would make the .NET world a completely different community.

> And you don&#8217;t have to take my word for this, go to your local (non-redmond) user group and ask a handful of developers what principles they develop by. Many will give you a blank stare. Ask them what OO principles are, and they might mutter inheritance or polymorphism. They don&#8217;t know that Liskov or Demeter fellow (or even what a Responsibility is).

Just so we are clear, this is NOT aimed at those closest to me (user group leaders, coworkers, etc).&nbsp; If you know me personally, don&#8217;t take offense at this, please. ðŸ˜‰

I DO know the lack of development principles and patterns to be accurate.&nbsp; I know it&#8217;s accurate because it wasn&#8217;t so long ago that \*I\* was a part of that.
