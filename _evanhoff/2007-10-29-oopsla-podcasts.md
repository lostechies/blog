If you are looking for some good podcasts to listen to, you might check out some of the <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2007/index.php?page=podcasts/" target="_blank">keynotes from OOPSLA 2007</a>.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve put them all out on the web.

I&#8217;m also super excited that they are doing <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/" target="_blank">OOPSLA 2008</a> right here in Nashville, TN.&nbsp; That rocks!!
