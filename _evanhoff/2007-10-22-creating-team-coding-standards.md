It&#8217;s nice when your entire team can agree on naming standards (at least).&nbsp; We are currently going through the process of formalizing a few of ours in the form of&nbsp;a very short Word doc.

For those looking for something to start from, here are a couple of resources:

  * <a href="http://www.idesign.net/idesign/download/IDesign%20WCF%20Coding%20Standard.zip" target="_blank">IDesign WCF Coding Standard</a>
  * <a href="http://www.idesign.net/idesign/download/IDesign%20CSharp%20Coding%20Standard.zip" target="_blank">IDesign C# Coding Standard</a>
  * <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xzf533w0(VS.71).aspx" target="_blank">MSDN Naming Guidelines</a>
  * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Development/dp/0321246756" target="_blank">Framework Design Guidelines</a>
  * <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Team/FxCop/" target="_blank">FxCop</a>

Just remember, don&#8217;t go crazy.&nbsp; They should be something everyone can agree on, and something you can give to new developers to reference.&nbsp; Anything more than a page or two is overkill.
