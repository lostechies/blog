So it&#8217;s been quite some time since my last post.&nbsp; I figured I&#8217;d put an ice breaker out to break the silence.&nbsp; This is it.

I&#8217;m going to attempt to post more often, but no promises.

As an interesting side note, I think I&#8217;ve noticed that I tend to prefer the bloggers that blog less but more often.&nbsp; The frequent posts that are a paragraph or two convey some small thought, but as a whole, the small thoughts are easier to follow as a stream.&nbsp; This is in direct&nbsp;comparison to the weekly post of random topics.&nbsp; Those tend to be hit and miss, and sometimes the context is greatly missing.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure my next few posts will suffer from a bit of missing context.&nbsp; Oh well, you just have to put it in gear and go.&nbsp; 

Or at least that&#8217;s my working theory.&nbsp; ðŸ˜‰
