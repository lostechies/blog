So, for the curious, they have an initiation ritual at Los Techies.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to spill the secret.&nbsp; 

From <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/default.aspx" target="_blank">Joe&#8217;s</a> emal:

> You must sacrifice a live chicken on the next full moon and praise the  
> computer gods for creating Assembler.&nbsp;&nbsp;After that you will have to tattoo  
> tux on one cheek and the MS Logo on other and on the nap of your back you&nbsp;  
> have to tattoo &#8220;They are both full of crap!&#8221; with an arrows pointing to both  
> cheeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a standard indoctrination for all Los Techies!

I immediately complied and here&#8217;s the photo of my cheeks to prove it:
