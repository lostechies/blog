These might not actually be the top 3, but I know they are going to be pretty close for most people:

  1. The Call Stack
  2. The Transaction
  3. The Layers Pattern

The first two are interesting in that they imply a specific paradigm of programming (whether good or bad), which is easy to implement and easy to think about, but ultimately, makes for a very poor choice in certain situations (yes, I&#8217;m being vague to stay out of a rabbit trail).

The 3rd I&#8217;ll pick on because without using the Layers pattern, most developers would be completely and utterly lost.&nbsp; In fact, this one is so in-grained, that many developers don&#8217;t even realize <a href="http://wiki.hsr.ch/APF/files/Layers.pdf" target="_blank">it&#8217;s a pattern</a>. So much for being pattern averse.&nbsp; **Can you actually make an informed choice when you know of only one option?**
