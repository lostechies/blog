I&#8217;m asking you, dear reader, is INETA still viable as an organization?

I don&#8217;t know about your local user groups, but here in Nashville, we don&#8217;t get nearly enough good speakers to fill our monthly timeslots.&nbsp; Worst of all, the presentations all seem to be the same.&nbsp; They are all basic introductions to whatever shiny new toy Microsoft has recently released.&nbsp; Way too much Microsoft, way too little programming.

There are, of course, some very good exceptions to that status quo.&nbsp; I personally really enjoyed seeing <a href="http://www.scottcate.com/" target="_blank">Scott Cate</a> when he came through town, and we were lucky enough to snag <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/" target="_blank">Ted Neward</a> for <a href="http://www.devlink.net/" target="_blank">DevLink</a>.&nbsp; But over all, the quality seems to be falling further and further below what I would consider a high quality outreach organization&#8211;at least one whose goals aren&#8217;t completely in line with that of a single product vendor.

Another issue that came up recently was the organization&#8217;s refusal to work with corporate user groups.&nbsp; While this might make sense for companies that might spin up something with only 2 or 3 people, it seems very silly when you work in an organization that employs 200+ .NET developers.&nbsp; It also makes no sense when you look at other organizations of the same size (say: Fedex).

So, here&#8217;s the question I would like you, the community, to answer.&nbsp; 

> Is INETA a concrete life-raft?

&nbsp;

For the curious, I currently play a small local role in the organization.&nbsp; As an attempt to continually improve my contributions to the community, I&#8217;m trying to determine the value I&#8217;m generating through the volunteering of my time.
