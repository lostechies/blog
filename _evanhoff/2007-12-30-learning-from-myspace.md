I wanted to draw attention to another valuable read.&nbsp; This one comes as a bit of a history of the design and architecture over at MySpace.

It&#8217;s quite an interesting read, and if you watched/read my previous two posts, you will see lots of overlap.

I really like how the authors broke the system history down into milestones of User Accounts.
