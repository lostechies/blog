This is a simple challenge.&nbsp; I want you to figure this out for yourself.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an important step I think every developer needs to take for him/herself.

Also, please don&#8217;t give any direct answers in the comments&nbsp;or I will delete them. Non-answer comments are perfectly acceptable.&nbsp; ðŸ™‚

Without further ado, can you please give a simple definition and compare the following:

  * Procedural Code
  * Object-based Code
  * Object-oriented Code

In particular, what&#8217;s the difference between object-based code and object-oriented code?&nbsp; I&#8217;ll give you a clue, it doesn&#8217;t particularly have anything to do with inheritance.

You might find these concepts in a few books.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll drop a couple references here.

  * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/C%2B%2B-Primer-4th-Stanley-Lippman/dp/0201721481/" target="_blank">C++ Primer</a> (Parts 3, 4, and 5)
  * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Design-Heuristics-Arthur-Riel/dp/020163385X" target="_blank">Object-Oriented Design Heuristics</a>

Finally, I&#8217;ll leave you with a slightly harder teaser problem.&nbsp; What&#8217;s an &#8220;Object Role&#8221;?

If you are unsure, feel free to drop me an email, and I&#8217;ll steer you in the right direction (evanatevanhoffdotcom).&nbsp; I&#8217;m not recommending those books for starters (although I&#8217;m sure they are great books).
