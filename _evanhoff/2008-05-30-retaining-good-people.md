This is largely common sense, but I&#8217;d bet there&#8217;s a large number of IT shops out there that haven&#8217;t picked up on this yet.

**Do you want to keep the best people on your staff?**

Make sure you have career paths for them.&nbsp; If there aren&#8217;t clear avenues for people to be promoted or advance, it means they will be forced to look outside your organization to move up.&nbsp; Those who are&nbsp;talented&nbsp;or work&nbsp;agressively to advance will be forced to leave as they become more skilled.&nbsp; 

If you are in an industry where prior domain knowledge is&nbsp;prized during the hiring process, that also means you will likely&nbsp;lose them to your competitor.&nbsp; Ouch.
