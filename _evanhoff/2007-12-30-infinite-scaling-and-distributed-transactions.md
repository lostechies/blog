I posted a link to this paper a few days agon on one of the mailinglists I subscribe to.&nbsp; I thought I would share with you guys as well:

[Life Beyond Distributed Transactions: An Apostate&#8217;s Opinion](http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p15.pdf)

This is a really good read from Pat Helland on scalability in really large applications.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not terribly new, but it&#8217;s definitely worth a read if you&#8217;ve not seen it before.

Personally, I like his descriptions of vertical and horizontal partitioning, but there&#8217;s quite a bit of meat there to chew on.

Pat Helland, btw, has worked for both Microsoft and Amazon.&nbsp; He was a key part of the team which designed the DTC.
