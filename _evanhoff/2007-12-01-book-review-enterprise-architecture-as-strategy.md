Environments where many applications and many development teams must&nbsp;talk have an additional layer of complexity surrounding them.&nbsp; The more integrated the applications have to become, the hairier it gets.&nbsp; If this scenario sounds like the company you are at, there&#8217;s a good change <a href="http://architectureasstrategy.com/book/eas/" target="_blank">this book</a> will bring some clarity to your world view. ðŸ™‚

I would recommend making sure you are familiar with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321200683/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-0704230-2308808?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194918493&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Enterprise Integration Patterns</a> first, however.&nbsp; Without some decent coverage of different Integration Topologies, it might be a bit hard to grasp the application of the material.

There were a number of things in this book that stood out to me.&nbsp; The first was the authors&#8217; introduction to four Operating Models: Unification, Coordination, Diversification, and Replication.&nbsp; The four models correspond directly to the model through which the business works.&nbsp; It&#8217;s important to note that the Operating Model is not determined by IT but should be selected during&nbsp;an engagement between IT and the business (sound familiar?) to determine how the business wants to grow and position itself.

Roughly speaking, there&#8217;s an interesting correlation between the Operating Models and the various Integration Topologies (Broker, Bus, Point-to-Point, etc).

There was a lot of focus on how processes differ across companies with different operating models.

I&#8217;m not going to go too deep into the rest of the book&#8217;s content, but I will say that it was a great read.&nbsp; It was a bit lighter than some of the other techincal books on my bookshelf, so that was a welcome change.
