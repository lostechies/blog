I tend to follow the news quite regularly, and if you are like me, you are probably aware of the catastrophe that is British Airlines and the new Heathrow T5 terminal.&nbsp; The accumulation of <a href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30400-1311192,00.html" target="_blank">a mountain of 20k pieces of luggage</a> should give you some indication of the size of the problem.&nbsp; The gist of the story is that a new Â£4.3 billion terminal just opened, and what was supposed to be a technologically advanced baggage handling system wasn&#8217;t quite up to task.

While I haven&#8217;t seen an official diagnosis of the problem, I can&#8217;t help but wonder if a group of software developers somewhere locked in a closet are to blame&#8211;not that I&#8217;ve ever seen a project end like that.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be curiously watching to see what some type of official report says.

This just brings back the thought of the FBI&#8217;s Virtual Case File, a <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/sep05/1455" target="_blank">$100 million software failure</a>.&nbsp; 

It looks like Jeff Atwood has a nice <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000588.html" target="_blank">collection of large scale failures</a> catalogued as well.
