What a whirlwind!&nbsp; I wanted to put together a few notes from my speaking engagements this year.&nbsp; I&#8217;m hoping they might be of use to any of you trying to do the same.

**Compuware Thought Leadership** 

I gave my first&nbsp;public presentation&nbsp;this past July&nbsp;to our local Compuware office (Thought Leadership).&nbsp; Needless to say, I overshot the amount of material I could pack into one session.&nbsp; I had previously decided that I wanted the talk to be on Dependency Injection, but I knew that without a healthy dose of OO, the material on DI wouldn&#8217;t be all that valuable.

I ended up spending most of the time explaining some OO concepts&nbsp;with DI as a segway at the end.

I was very well prepared (with <a href="http://www.evanhoff.com/downloads/thoughtleadership.zip" target="_blank">a stack of Powerpoint slides</a>), but didn&#8217;t do a good job packaging my sample code for the people who attended (and wanted a copy).

Looking back, I&#8217;m ok with the fact that I didn&#8217;t get too deep into DI.&nbsp; I think I did the right thing for the situation.&nbsp; I do think, however, I tried to pack too much information into one session.&nbsp; Some presenters have the Information Overload style, which I think accurately reflects that talk.

_Lessons Learned:&nbsp;Avoid Information Overload, Less is More with Powerpoint, Make sure to have a good ratio of Visual Studio to Powerpoint time_

**Nashville BarCamp**

For my second talk, I did a last minute entry over at the Nashville BarCamp in August.&nbsp; The talk was on Agile Development, and felt pretty much the opposite of my first.&nbsp; If my first talk was characterized by being overprepared and overstuffed with information, my second talk was quite the opposite.&nbsp; I spent a lot of time deciding on what I wanted to communicate, but I wanted to pull back on the reins a bit.&nbsp; 

While I do think I said a lot of what I wanted to say, I don&#8217;t think I effectively communicated it to the audience.&nbsp; While I successfully avoided the slide-per-minute logjam, I didn&#8217;t have anything to communicate to my audience visibly.

It was an interesting experience.&nbsp; The BarCamp had a decidely marketing feel to it, so I&nbsp;wasn&#8217;t speaking to a good target audience for Development Methodology.

_Lessons Learned:&nbsp; Some Visual Aid is Necessary, Double Check Conference Agendas to get a feel for the target audience_

**Nashville Agile Users Group**

A few days&nbsp;following the Nashville BarCamp, I spoke at the Nashville Agile Users Group.&nbsp; The title of the presentation was <a href="http://www.evanhoff.com/archive/2007/07/27/42.aspx" target="_blank">&#8220;Agile in the Enterprise&#8221;</a>.&nbsp; Given that our Agile group was really small, I felt comfortable giving a talk about a topic I have spent&nbsp;quite a bit of time studying this past year: messaging and event-driven systems.

I had a fairly decent amount of powerpoint, and spent some time whiteboarding.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end, the presentation had drifted into a full-fledged discussion.&nbsp; When it was over, I had several people tell me they greatly enjoyed the presentation.&nbsp; I, too, had learned some new things from those around me.&nbsp; Win/Win

Looking back, I should have spaced those two talks apart more.&nbsp; I would have done better on each if I had.&nbsp; I was happy with the result I got from speaking at the User Group, but I think it could have been even better, with a bit of polishing.

_Lessons Learned:&nbsp; You need several weeks between new presentations,&nbsp; Don&#8217;t read from Powerpoint, Engaging the audience is a good thing_

**Tulsa Tech Fest**

I was very happy to be given the chance to speak at <a href="http://www.tulsatechfest.com/" target="_blank">Tulsa Tech Fest 2007</a>&nbsp;in October.&nbsp; I think, by far, it was my best presentation.&nbsp; The talk was entitled &#8220;A Beginners Introduction to TDD&#8221;.&nbsp; You might notice the emphasis on the introductory nature of the talk (&#8220;beginners introduction&#8221;), and that was on purpose.&nbsp; Prior to the talk, I spent time crafting only a handful of slides with meaningful or catchy photos (hat tip to Dave Laribee for help with the slides).&nbsp; I also took the time to do a screencast of my code demo the week before.

Needless to say, I think the presentation delivered the correct balance of Visual Studio time and Powerpoint time.&nbsp; And it didn&#8217;t hurt when JetBrains gave&nbsp;me a free license of ReSharper to give away at the end. ðŸ˜‰

_Lessons Learned: Giveaways Rock, Screencasting the Code Demo beforehand make you uber confident, Well prepared Powerpoint presentations are an asset, Delivering&nbsp;a well-crafted presentation can be a very satisfying activity_

**Looking Into 2008**

In 2008 I hope to replicate the balance I found giving my presentation in Tulsa, while trying to improve it even more.&nbsp; Having given 4 presentations in the past 6 months, I&#8217;m going to give myself the goal of giving 6&nbsp;well-crafted presentations in 2008.&nbsp; 

I&#8217;ll be starting the year off right with another presentation to our local Compuware office this month.
