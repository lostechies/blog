Last monday (8th of Feb) I did an [E-VAN on Git](http://jagregory.com/writings/git-e-van/); an introductory talk on Git and DVCS, covering pretty much everything you need to know for day-to-day Git life. I think it went down well, certainly didn&#8217;t _hear_ anyone complaining.

The talk was recorded, so if you haven&#8217;t already seen it then you can do so at your own leisure.

The video is up on the [E-VAN&#8217;s Vimeo account](http://vimeo.com/user1286822), specifically [here](http://vimeo.com/9324683 "Git E-VAN recording").</p>
