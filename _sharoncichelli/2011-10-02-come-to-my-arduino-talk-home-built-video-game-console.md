This Thursday at [CTXNA](http://www.ctxna.org/), I&#8217;ll give an intro to the Arduino microcontroller, including a walk-through of how I followed [PragPub&#8217;s instructions](http://pragprog.com/magazines/2011-08/make-your-own-video-game-system) to build a [video game console](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spyderella/sets/72157627380791482/). Please join us!

No experience necessary. Interactive and fun. Bring your Arduino projects to share if ya got &#8217;em. Did I mention I built a video game console? ðŸ˜€

Please [sign up to say you&#8217;re coming](http://ctxna.eventbrite.com/) so that Tim knows how much food to order.
