I&#8217;m presenting an introduction to the Arduino microcontroller at [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org) Friday morning at 9:30. [Resources for getting started with the Arduino](http://www.girlwritescode.com/2013/01/hello-arduino-lets-get-started.html) are on [GirlWritesCode.com](http://www.girlwritescode.com/).

If you&#8217;re at CodeMash, I invite you to the talk. It&#8217;ll be a blast, and I have a cool giveaway from [MakerShed](https://twitter.com/makershed) and [O&#8217;Reilly Media](https://twitter.com/oreillymedia).
