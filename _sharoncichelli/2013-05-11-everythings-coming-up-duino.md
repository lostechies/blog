I just went to Barnes and Noble and bought a magazine with my name in it. ðŸ˜€

Check it out: [&#8220;Hello, Arduino&#8221; in _CODE Magazine_](http://code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=1305081), an introduction to the programmable microcontroller designed to be approachable and fun. If you&#8217;ve ever had a hankering to see your code manifest your will in the corporeal world, you&#8217;ll love the Arduino. My article will take you step-by-step through a &#8220;Hello, World&#8221; project, even (especially!) if you&#8217;re a complete beginner to electronics.

(Why&#8217;d I buy the magazine? Not to worry, EPS sent me three copies of my own, as is right and proper. I just wanted an extra one to leave at [TechShop](http://techshop.ws/). Plus, what a thrill to purchase a magazine with my words and ideas in it! &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d like a latte and _maybe you recognize the author of this article_, hmm?&#8221; Regrettable narcissism, I know.)

I&#8217;ll be giving an [Arduino presentation at That Conference](http://www.thatconference.com/Sessions/session_614) in August in Wisconsin. Please come to my talk, say hi, show me what you&#8217;re building!

If you&#8217;re a parent or get to hang out with kids on a regular basis, introduce them to the Arduino. You will have a blast building stuff together. Here is a nine-year-old developer I pair-programmed with at CodeMash (she specified the requirements and did all the typing):

I&#8217;d love to hear about your projects. Make great stuff!
