Welcome, [Ignite/Dorkbot Science Fair](http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotaustin/2011/03/dorkbot-28-sxsw-2011-science-fair-pesenters/) Party Goers. Here are details on the two projects I had with me at the Science Fair.

I used the open-source [Arduino microcontroller](http://arduino.cc/). Arduino programs are called &#8220;sketches.&#8221; I keep my Arduino sketches on the collaborative source-code repository [GitHub](https://github.com/), in my [Arduino-Sketches repository](https://github.com/scichelli/Arduino-Sketches). You can browse the code in a web browser without installing Git, so go check it out. And then learn Git and post your own sketches.

The Ambient Clock is an information radiator for the passage of time. It was written up on the [Makezine blog](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/10/ambient-led-flowerpot-clock.html).

The Blinky Eyeball Halloween Nightmare is, um, pretty self-describing.
