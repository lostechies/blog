I am the lucky donkey who gets to announce [Patrick Lioi](http://lostechies.com/patricklioi) has joined Los Techies. I&#8217;ve benefited from working with Patrick at two jobs now; the first was a happy coincidence, the second, quite deliberate.

Patrick is interested in what makes programming languages tick. To that end, he&#8217;s built a [lexer/parser called Parsley](https://github.com/plioi/parsley/), which he uses in the [compiler for Rook](https://github.com/plioi/rook/), a language he&#8217;s designing. His latest endeavor is [Fixie, a unit-testing framework](https://github.com/plioi/fixie/), and he&#8217;s been chronicling his progress and discoveries on [Fixie&#8217;s project page](http://patrick.lioi.net/fixie/). (You can also find him on Twitter as [@plioi](https://twitter.com/plioi/).)

Patrick has presented at the [Austin Code Camp](http://codecamp13.adnug.org/), [Polyglot Programmers of Austin](http://austin.polyglotprogrammers.org/), and the [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/) lightning talks. You&#8217;ll likely see him at [Pablo&#8217;s Fiesta](http://lostechies.github.io/fiesta/) (which you&#8217;re going to, right?).

I&#8217;m delighted Patrick will be joining our community. I think you&#8217;ll get a real kick out of what he has to say.
