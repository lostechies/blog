From the opening session of Alt.Net 2007&#8230;

Nearly as loud as the argument about changing the Alt.Net name is the camp saying &#8220;who cares what it&#8217;s named?&#8221;

I don&#8217;t have a problem with the Alt.Net name, and I&#8217;m past bored with the argument, but I do like showing off what I know about linguistics, to try and justify some of that expensive schooling.

The [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_Hypothesis) posits that the way we use language informs and constrains the way we think about the world: Language shapes thought. So arguing about the words we use may be not only relevant, but vital.

Many years ago I went to a play where an actor presented a monologue as if he were Buckminster Fuller. I never know how to attribute quotes from this event; I probably need to find the playwright. Anyway, this non-Bucky gave an example of how language changes our thinking. Why do we say &#8220;up&#8221; and &#8220;down,&#8221; when we live on a sphere? We should say &#8220;out&#8221; and &#8220;in.&#8221;

Dizzying, isn&#8217;t it?

So it _is_ important how you name your test methods, and whether you review &#8220;defects&#8221; or &#8220;items,&#8221; &#8230;and what you call your social movement.

But debate about it later on blogs. While we&#8217;re all here, let&#8217;s talk about _code_, man.
