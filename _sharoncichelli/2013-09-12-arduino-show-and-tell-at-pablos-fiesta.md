My favorite conference is coming up! (Shh, you&#8217;re all my favorites; now hush.) [Pablo&#8217;s Fiesta](https://lostechies.github.io/fiesta/) has the most engaging density of relevant content because _we_ make the content. You and me (and some other folks), on Friday evening, propose Saturday&#8217;s topics.

You don&#8217;t have to be an expert to convene a session. In fact, better than answers are **Interesting Questions**. Ever gone to a talk and been disappointed when the delivery didn&#8217;t line up with your expectations? How &#8217;bout instead: Call a session with an interesting question, facilitate a discussion amongst creative thinkers and boundary pushers, capture and publish some notes afterwards, and you get to have exactly the conference session you wanted to attend.

_Sharon, you mentioned Arduino?_

Oh, right! Here&#8217;s the session I want to convene, and I&#8217;m mentioning it here now so that you can prep a little. (That&#8217;s allowed.)

<span style="font-size: 2em;">Arduino -ino -ino! Show and Tell -ell -ell!</span>

_Too much reverb._

<span style="font-size: .7em;">Sorry.</span> Arduino Show and Tell:

  * Bring something you made, or at least be ready to describe it. 
  * Plan for 2 to 3 minutes, so that lots of people can have a turn. 
  * Photos and things to pass around are cool. 
  * No computer slide-shows (PowerPoints/KeyNotes), because _logistics_.
  * Tell us why, and tell us how.
  * What are the big concepts? Draw a block diagram on the whiteboard?
  * PIC, Propeller, Stamp, Netduino, Raspberry Pi&#8230; microcontroller buddies of all types are welcome. &#8220;Physical Computing Show and Tell&#8221; just didn&#8217;t have the same ring.
  * Fun!

If you don&#8217;t yet have a project but are curious, this session is bound to get you bristling with ideas and inspiration. Please join us.
