Come hang out with us this Thursday. [Polyglot Programmers of Austin](http://www.polyglotprogrammers.org/) is a co-working study group for people learning a new programming language (or their first), 2nd and 4th Thursdays. We bring our laptops and work individually or in pairs or groups on self-directed projects. Some folks are chatty and some work quietly; we have enough separate spaces to accommodate both. A few attendees are new to developing, and we&#8217;re _all_ beginners at our topic of choice (that&#8217;s the point). A whole host of languages and technologies have shown up at meetings so far: iOS, Sinatra, Haskell, Backbone, HTML5, Clojure, Prolog&#8230; What would _you_ like to be working on?
