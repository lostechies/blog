It&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Resolution time, but this applies to Quarterly Objectives and other professional development goals, too. Set your goals around behaviors that are under your control. Sounds trivial, but it isn&#8217;t how most people write goals.

&#8220;Lose weight&#8221; isn&#8217;t something you can _do_. Not to say it isn&#8217;t something that can happen, but it&#8217;s an outcome, not a behavior you can modify. &#8220;Cook at home five days a week,&#8221; on the other hand, or &#8220;play outside with the kids three times a week,&#8221; those are things you can do&mdash;behaviors within your [locus of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control)&mdash;that will propel you towards that desired outcome.

I remember one project where, during go-live, we deployed a quick fix that had to be quick un-fixed. The dev who&#8217;d written the problem code resolved to &#8220;be more careful in the future.&#8221; That makes it sound like carefulness is just a dial you could turn up. Just&#8230; _think_ more. That doesn&#8217;t work. Carefulness, like health, is an outcome, not a behavior unto itself. We collaborated to come up with some behaviors he&#8217;d try that should result in carefulness, such as [diff-ing files before committing them](https://lostechies.com/sharoncichelli/2011/05/17/diffing-files-to-avoid-easy-goofs/ "Diffing Files to Avoid Easy Goofs") and having a quick assumption-vetting chat with a teammate before developing an on-the-fly fix.

One barometer I use to judge whether I&#8217;m targeting behaviors I can control is: Can someone else tell when I&#8217;m doing it? Can I tell when I&#8217;m done? Will I be able to check off that goal as accomplished? For example, with a goal like &#8220;learn Python,&#8221; it&#8217;s hard to say when you&#8217;re done learning it. There&#8217;s always more learning to do. But &#8220;build a Twitter-enabled temperature monitor for my barbecue smoker in Python on a Raspberry Pi&#8221;? _That_ is a goal worth doing. And you get to learn Python.

All this hints at the M in [SMART goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria "SMART criteria definition on Wikipedia"), but I find that mnemonic rather encumbered. When I&#8217;m writing goals with my mentees&mdash;or for myself&mdash;we get a lot of mileage from these two simple tests:

  * Is it within your control?
  * Can you tell when you&#8217;re done?
