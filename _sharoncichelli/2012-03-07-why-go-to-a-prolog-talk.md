I&#8217;m famous![*](#famousfootnote) At this year&#8217;s [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org/) conference, [O&#8217;Reilly Media interviewed CodeMash attendees about our languages and technologies of interest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9TDV6ZAiMM), and I&#8217;m in it. Now take note of my face starting at 1:15, when I&#8217;m asked what programming language I&#8217;d like to learn. My excitement is palpable, and I&#8217;m still that excited, _and_ working on it, two months later. (Come play with us at [Polyglot Programmers of Austin](http://www.polyglotprogrammers.org/), any language you like.)

I work in C# all day every day. Why go to a talk on Prolog? (And one on Erlang, and one on Ruby, and&#8230;)

Whenever I go to a conference, I feel a tension between &#8220;sessions that are good for my job&#8221; (broccoli) and &#8220;sessions that just sound _fun_&#8221; (ice cream). Happiness lies in striking a balance. Just as your palate thrives on diversity (and ice cream), here are some benefits of attending those odd-ball sessions at conferences.

  1. You encounter **new ideas and new approaches** which might, in fact, apply to your every-day language.
  2. It **adds a tool to your workbench**, a new way to solve a problem. And even if you choose to stick with your typical language instead of that new tool, now you&#8217;ve _made a choice_.
  3. You **meet another camp of developers**. Be the slice in the Venn diagram of programmer communities. Untold synergies open up when you know a diverse crowd.
  4. It&#8217;s **invigorating**. The beach ball of your programmer motivation is batted back into the air again.
  5. You **learn what your language does** by contrasting it with the choices made in another language. Like with human languages; prepositions such as &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;in&#8221; might seem like fundamental truths of the universe, until you learn that they&#8217;re just a quirk of English and other languages don&#8217;t have analogous concepts.
  6. You might **be inspired to start something** like Polyglot Programmers, which arose out of my desire to _be a member_ of such a group. I wanted it to exist, so I made it exist. Other people apparently want it to exist, too, so now it&#8217;s a collaboration; even better. (Thanks in particular to [Todd Wood](http://www.woodcp.com/) and to [Headspring](http://www.headspring.com/).)
  7. Look at that cool O&#8217;Reilly video again. Being interested in a variety of things **makes you more interesting**.
  8. It gives me **something to share with [Dad](http://newspapersystems.com/articles.html)**.

Balance, as has been stated, is key. One cannot live on ice cream alone, and I attended a number of superlative C# sessions at CodeMash, including talks from [Jon Skeet](http://csharpindepth.com/), [Bill Wagner](http://www.srtsolutions.com/author/billwagner), [Mark Rendle](http://about.me/markrendle), and [Keith Elder](http://keithelder.net/), that gave me plenty to think about. I just want to tell you, if you&#8217;re subjecting yourself to a strict code of austerity: It&#8217;s okay to have dessert.
