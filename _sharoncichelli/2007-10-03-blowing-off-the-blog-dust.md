Funny thing about using [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29) at work: there was suddenly a lot more _work_ at work. Fun and consuming work. So I stepped out of the blogosphere and began to live in my IDE.

Three changes bring me back:

  1. I&#8217;ve missed you guys.
  2. If I&#8217;m going to talk amongst the software development community, I need my own voice.
  3. I had to find a new server for my at-work blog, so&#8230; what the hey?

My topics will include:

  * software development
  * agile methodologies
  * collaborating across multiple countries
  * requirements gathering
  * industry conferences
  * book reviews
  * and, from time to time, stuff that falls under that weird category, &#8220;life.&#8221;
