Technical books are longer than they ought to be. Most software books could be improved by shedding a tenth of their heft. It&#8217;s a product of market pressures, of course: Tech books need to get to market _fast_, which does not allow for the time-consuming labor of honing and refining a text until it is lean and tight. I have a few simple strategies, though&mdash;simple tips that provide a disproportionately beneficial return on a trivial time investment. You can use the following tips to improve your blog posts, books, and presentations.

## Replace &#8220;basically&#8221; with nothing.

This word never adds value. It is usually a manifestation of the author&#8217;s or speaker&#8217;s unconscious concern that what he is explaining is too complex. If time allows, revise the material until your readers don&#8217;t need extra convincing that it is basic. At least get rid of the useless word.

You could have some fun writing a regular expression to correct all instances with a global search-and-replace. If you&#8217;re amused by the challenge, please feel free to post your regex in the comments. You&#8217;d be helping all of us.

Here are the replacements your regex would need to catch:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Find
    </th>
    
    <th>
      Result
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <span style="background-color:#cccccc">Basically, i</span>t can start a sentence.
    </td>
    
    <td>
      It can start a sentence.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <span style="background-color:#cccccc">Basically p</span>eople leave off the comma, too.
    </td>
    
    <td>
      People leave off the comma, too.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      It can <span style="background-color:#cccccc">basically&nbsp;</span>appear in the middle.
    </td>
    
    <td>
      It can appear in the middle.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      It can<span style="background-color:#cccccc">, basically,</span> be set off with commas.
    </td>
    
    <td>
      It can be set off with commas.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      It can end a sentence<span style="background-color:#cccccc">, basically</span>.
    </td>
    
    <td>
      It can end a sentence.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      It might end without a comma<span style="background-color:#cccccc">&nbsp;basically</span>.
    </td>
    
    <td>
      It might end without a comma.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Replace &#8220;essentially&#8221; with nothing.

As above.

## Replace &#8220;is nothing more than&#8221; with &#8220;is.&#8221;

The &#8220;is nothing more than&#8221; construction falls in the category of noisy hedge words. It&#8217;s a large category. Folks add words to forestall arguments. Even though it sounds romantically brash&mdash;X is _nothing_ but Y, #wristforehead&mdash;it actually weakens the association between the subject and its predicate nominative. Be clear; be bold. If you&#8217;re trying to define X by saying that it is Y, say that X is Y.

I wish the industry allowed more time for editing. I wish I were able to help more people express their ideas. Good editing is liberating, plucking the brambles and cruft off a passage until its central theme floats to the fore&mdash;getting the _text_ out of the way of the _writing_.

I hope you find these tips helpful and easy to implement. Ruthlessly delete useless clutter like &#8220;basically,&#8221; &#8220;essentially,&#8221; and &#8220;nothing more than.&#8221; Let your ideas stand tall.
