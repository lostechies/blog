Once I discovered the secret of how to adjust the playback speed of [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/)&rsquo;s training videos, deciding to subscribe became trivially easy. It was never the financial cost that stayed my hand, because the content is excellent, relevant, and plentiful; it was the time, and the irritation of having someone talk more slowly than I was ready to listen. Now that I&#8217;ve solved this, I _must_ share.

Step 1: **Use Internet Explorer.** (You can see why I wasn&#8217;t going to stumble upon this answer without help.)

The bottom-left of the Windows Media Player offers a slider to adjust playback speed. 

Listening to an hour of content in 38 minutes makes me feel like a Time Lord. Learning&#8230; faster! Enjoy.
