My wife is running in this years CIBC Run for the cure, on Sunday October. 5th 2008. This is an annual fund raiser to raise money for breast cancer research. This is a cause that is near and dear to us since she has lost loved ones in her family to breast cancer.

The donations are tax deductible, here in Canada, and receipts are sent out electronically. There is no minimum donation, so anything and everything counts. Please don&#8217;t be shy!

If you would like to support my wife and daughter before their 5 KM walk please make a donation [here](https://www.cibcrunforthecure.com/html/personal_page.asp?track=2822080&languageid=1).

> &#8220;I am excited to be joining team Glamma&#8217;s and friends this year to walk for breast cancer. My Mom and friends will be walking their 4th year and Adia and I are thrilled to be the newest members. As breast cancer has touched my life on both maternal and paternal sides of my family, it&#8217;s time to be proactive in finding a cure for this disease. I deeply appreciate your support; by donation, cheers on the sidelines or joining our team!&#8221;
