I’m still surprised by just how many people still aren’t using ReSharper. It’s an amazing productivity adding for Microsoft Visual Studio.&#160; Once you’ve spent the time learning a few keyboard shortcuts you will not go back to naked studio.

There are few things that are more frustrating then jumping on a machine that doesn’t have ReSharper installed, then trying to edit some .cs files.

In an effort to prevent myself from ever having to jump on a pc that’s still missing the glory of ReSharper, I decided to throw together a quick screen cast showcasing some of the features i enjoy.

If you haven’t already… please, please [give it a try](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) (do it for me). It’s a good [addiction](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+4.5+Nightly+Builds)!
