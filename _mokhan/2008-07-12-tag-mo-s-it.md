So [JP](http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/HowDidIGetStartedInSoftwareDevelopment.aspx) had to tag me&#8230; then the [Los Techies crew](http://www.lostechies.com/) had to invite me to join Los Techies. This sucks for someone who **"claims"** to be quite a private person. Thanks JP for putting me in the [spotlight](http://mokhan.ca/blog/2007/10/04/The+Spotlight+Theory.aspx), and thanks to all the [techies](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2008/07/12/lostechies-welcomes-mo-khan.aspx) who thought I was fit to join. So here goes&#8230;

**How old were you when you first started in programming?**

I was in grade 11, so I guess that would have made me 15. 

**How did you get started in programming?**

Hmm&#8230; Kind of by accident. I took a C++ course in high school as an option and I found that I actually liked it. I didn&#8217;t actually think I was capable of becoming a software developer, but I knew I liked it.

**What was your first programming language?**

C++

**What was the first real program you wrote?**

In college I signed up for a curriculum that focused more on electrical engineering than software development. However we got a little bit of exposure with different programming languages like assembler and C.

The first actual program that I finished was in my second year of college. We wrote a piece of voice recognition software using MatLab. It was actually a tonne of fun, because it required us to utilize what we had learned about digital signal processing as well as how to pick up a brand new language and learn how to get something compiling with it in a short bit of time. This was probably when I realized I liked staring at code more than I liked staring at circuit diagrams.

**What languages have you used since you started programming?**

Assembler, C, C++, C#, T-SQL, VB, VB.NET, MatLab. The languages I would say I&#8217;m ok in are C and C#.

**What was your first professional programming gig?**

Right after college I got scooped up by a company called [DataShapers](http://datashapers.com), where I got to work on a project called [Incentus](http://incentus.ca). It was a Gift Card, and Loyalty Management system. I was hired to build embedded gift card applications for different point of sale terminals. 

I was quite fortunate that I got to work on such a sweet project right out of school. I was exposed to things like chip cards, 3DES encryption, SSL/TLS at a raw sockets level written in C. I was fortunate enough to be mentored by one of the best while I was there. Thanks [Mr. Mark](http://dsmarkchen.blogspot.com/)! 

**If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?**

Oh&#8230; yes!

**If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?**

**Actually** listen to your elders, and follow through with what they tell you. At the same time, question everything they tell you, and decide what&#8217;s right for you.

_"Listen to your elders, but question everything they tell you."_

**What&#8217;s the most fun you&#8217;ve ever had programming?**

[The Nothin&#8217; But .NET boot camp](http://jpboodhoo.com/training.oo) (times 2)&#8230; seriously, it blows my mind!

**Who am I calling out?**

**[Luu Duong](http://luuduong.ca/blog/)**

**[Mark Chen](http://dsmarkchen.blogspot.com/)**

**[Owen Rogers](http://exortech.com/blog/)**

**[Adam Alinauskas](http://streamlinelogic.ca) (whenever he gets his blog back up)**
