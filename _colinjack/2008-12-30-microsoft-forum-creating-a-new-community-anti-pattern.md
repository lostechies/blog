I&#8217;ve recently had reason to ask questions on the Oslo and [WCF](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wcf/threads/) forums and in both cases my posts got responses quickly (which is more than can be said for the [WCF REST starter kit forum](http://forums.asp.net/1180.aspx) which is dead as a doornail). However in both cases a strange thing then happened, someone else immediately&nbsp;marked the answer given as being _THE_ answer to my question.

So instead of the person asking the question getting a chance to decide if the answer was suitable, or whether they wanted more information (in both cases I did), a higher authority decided (presumably the person providing the answer). Why does this matter, well apart from anything else&nbsp;answered questions get a tick when displayed in the list and who in their right mind is going to want to help answer an already answered question?

To me this seems like a big community anti-pattern, but it all makes sense when you read the [sticky post on marking answers](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wcf/thread/401a101c-8518-48e6-9c9c-771f36ceae1e) in the WCF forum. One key line is:

_Our forum gets &#8216;measured&#8217; based on how many unanswered questions are in it at any time and we work hard to keep those numbers to as low a level as possible. By marking answers, others get a more accurate understanding of how well (or badly) things are going on the forum._

Incentivise people to mark questions answered and thats what they do, who whould have thought? 

Mind you on the right&nbsp;handside of the&nbsp;front page of the&nbsp;forum you also get a list of the &#8220;Top Answerers&#8221; which is also an amusing idea and probably not one I&#8217;d want to see on any forums I use regularly.
