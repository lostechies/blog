I&#8217;ll cut straight to the chase, I definitely recommend [SOA Patterns](http://www.manning.com/rotem/) to anyone interested in SOA. 

Even though its currently only available in MEAP, and is a bit rough and ready, and isn&#8217;t complete, it&#8217;s still great stuff and well worth your time.

Now I&#8217;ve said that I&#8217;ll give a quick run through. Essentially the author, [Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz](http://www.rgoarchitects.com/nblog/default.aspx), has decided to focus on the practical aspects of SOA and in particular with a focus on the software architecture aspects of SOA. It thus doesn&#8217;t cover the business aspects of SOA, which is fine with me as those topics are covered elsewhere.

With that tight focus in mind Arnon has already managed to pack in a range of very interesting and valuable patterns. Each pattern includes the problem, solution, technology mapping and quality attributes. There is already the feeling of a pattern language about it which I think will evolve as later chapters are added, this should allow you to describe a complex system with just a few high level patterns or to dig into more detail by discussing the lower level patterns they compose.

You can actually read a few of the patterns online, see the [linked PDFs](http://www.rgoarchitects.com/SOAPatterns/) and also the [Blogjecting Watchdog](http://www.rgoarchitects.com/nblog/2009/04/30/SOAPatternsNdashBlogjectingWatchdog.aspx) pattern, and the anti-pattern called [The Knot](http://www.rgoarchitects.com/Files/SOAPatterns/TheKnot.pdf) is also worth a read. 

In addition [Jan has posted a review](http://vanryswyckjan.blogspot.com/2009/04/half-book-review-soa-patterns.html) of the book.
