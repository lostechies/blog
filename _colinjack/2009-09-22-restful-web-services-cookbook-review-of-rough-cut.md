I&#8217;ve just finished reading the rough cut of [RESTful Web Services Cookbook](http://www.restful-webservices-cookbook.org/) by [Subbu Allamaraju](http://www.subbu.org/) and [Mike Amundsen](http://www.amundsen.com/blog/) and thought I&#8217;d write a very quick review. 

Ultimately the book fills a gap in the market by providing practical advice on designing high quality HTTP/REST solutions and I found the recipe approach really accessible. 

Its also an easy read so if you&#8217;ve been toying with REST but haven&#8217;t found it very easy to get your head around then I&#8217;d definitely recommend having a look. I know that when I started learning REST I wasted large amounts of time reading unhelpful and downright misleading content so its good to have a book that should help you avoid falling into any obvious traps.

In summary, highly recommended.
