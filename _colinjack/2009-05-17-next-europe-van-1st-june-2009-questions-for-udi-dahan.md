[Udi Dahan](http://www.udidahan.com/?blog=true) has been kind enough to agree to do the next Europe VAN and suggested that we all put forward our questions for him to answer. 

Its a great chance to ask him about DDD/SOA/CQS/messaging/[NServiceBus](http://www.nservicebus.com/), or any other topic, so if you have any questions post them here or on the associated thread on the [DDD](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/domaindrivendesign/message/13099)/[ALT.NET](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altdotnet/message/21931) forums.

[Jan](http://vanryswyckjan.blogspot.com/2009/05/next-european-van-on-1st-june-2009.html) and I will aggregate the questions on the 25th May (after adding our own!) and then submit them to Udi so make sure you&#8217;ve submitted yours before then. _Just to confirm, you need to get your questions to us no later than Monday the 25th May or we&#8217;ll ignore them_.
