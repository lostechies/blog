After a bit of discussion [Jan](http://elegantcode.com/about/jan-van-ryswyck/) and I have decided that for now it seems to make sense to run the Europe VAN every two weeks, we have discussed having more open discussions on alternate weeks but we&#8217;ll have to see if there is an appetite for that. 

[Seb](http://serialseb.blogspot.com/) has agreed to do the next one on REST and his [OpenRasta](http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/04/using-rasta-1-introduction.html) framework. 

**Start Time:** Wednesday Feb 25, 2009 7:00 PM GMT 

**End Time:** Wednesday, Feb 25, 2009 09:00 PM GMT
