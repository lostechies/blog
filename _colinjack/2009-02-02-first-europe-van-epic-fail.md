The first Europe VAN went off without a hitch and was an amazing success. Ha, yeah sorry about that. 

Good news is next one is BOUND to be better and we are trying again very soon. Next time we&#8217;ll come armed with a backup plan too, possibly involving one us loading up the Dark Knight DVD so we can all watch it for an hour or two.
