First off if you didn&#8217;t watch [Udi Dahan](http://www.udidahan.com/?blog=true) talk on the SOA then you missed a treat, a real pro speaking on a topic that he and a very few others in the .NET space are way ahead of the rest of us on. Brilliant stuff and the [video is now online at Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/5022174).

### **Next E-VAN**

We&#8217;ve also now planned the next couple of E-VANs which will focus on REST, the first will be with Alan Dean where he will cover facts and fallacies related to REST:

**Start Time:** Monday, July 06, 2009 07:00 PM GMT *

**End Time:** Monday, July 06, 2009 08:30 PM GMT 

**Attendee URL:** <http://snipr.com/virtualaltnet> (Live Meeting) 

[Alan](http://alandean.blogspot.com/) is a real authority on REST and he&#8217;s got a great talk ready so this is a great chance to find out more about REST. In addition if you have any particular questions for Alan, or topics you&#8217;d like to discuss in detail, then you can add them to the existing topic on the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/europevan/browse_thread/thread/8afe38a99d204e52#).

* On timings see this [world clock site](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/) but for those of you in the UK it will start at 8:00 PM. I must admit time zones are beyond me though&#8230;.

### **Future E-VANs**

[Stefan Tilkov](http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/) has kindly agreed to do another E-VAN one on REST at the start of August. In addition we are going to see if we can organize another one for mid-July, creating a bit of a REST theme for the next month or so which we hope you&#8217;ll enjoy.

We&#8217;ve also got a couple of people in mind that we want to get on looking further into August and beyond, more to come on that once myself and [Jan](http://vanryswyckjan.blogspot.com/) contact the people ðŸ˜›

### **Feedback &#8211; Tell us how to do better**

So far I think the E-VAN is going well, great people talking about interesting topics. Live Meeting has been a bit flaky and time zones are a pain but other than that I&#8217;m pretty happy with it. 

However we want to know where you guys think things can improve so if you get a chance we&#8217;d be interested in hearing your feedback using the new [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/europevan/topics?start=). I&#8217;m interested to see if we can get more open discussions going and to explore whether an online book club is a good idea&#8230;
