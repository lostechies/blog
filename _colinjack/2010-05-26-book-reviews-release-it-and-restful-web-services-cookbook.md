I’ve recently been doing a lot more reading and wanted to recommend two excellent books. 

First is [Release It!](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mnee/release-it), put simply I think every developer should read it as it’s full of good patterns/advice/anti-patterns related to ensuring your software behaves appropriately in production. As with all good patterns books you’ll probably already know some of the content but if so you’ll want to read it just to find out the pattern names. Oh and its also a really enjoyable read, so there’s really no excuse for avoiding it.

The other one is [RESTful Web Services Cookbook](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596801694) which is a down to earth guide to how to develop RESTful services over HTTP. Its full of ridiculously practical patterns and if you are interested in REST, or are using REST currently, then I think this is a good book to have by your desk.
