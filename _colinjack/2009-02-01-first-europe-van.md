Just a reminder that the first Europe VAN is tomorrow: 

**Start Time:** Monday, Feb 02, 2009 7:00 PM GMT

**End Time:** Monday, Feb 02, 2009 09:00 PM GMT 

**Attendee URL:** <http://snipr.com/virtualaltnet> (Live Meeting) 

Greg Young has been kind enough to agree to speak and I&#8217;m hopeful it&#8217;ll go well as we&#8217;ve had a couple of dry runs so it&#8217;s looking good, even if I was perturbed to found out [Jan](http://elegantcode.com/2009/01/29/european-virtual-altnet-meeting-on-02022009/) speaks better English than me.
