I have been spending half of my day lately with my head in microservices on one project or another. Makes it a great topic to create content around as there is no context switching required.  As such I am currently preparing to do a lightning talk at June&#8217;s Azure Austin meetup on the topic.  Trying to speak in a condensed manner on such a broad topic forces you to focus a bit.

The next post will have more meat on the subject for those interested in brass tacks.  Gabriel and I are likely going to pair to deliver a chaotic system with one foot in every system to really show the composite application concept&#8230;with desperate technology choices that can be persuaded to interact with one another.
