Good morning all! Some of you may be aware that I run a couple of user groups.  Figured I would let you all know about the user groups that are coming up in our near future.

## Azure Austin

[Azure Austin](http://www.meetup.com/azureaustin/) meets every third Wednesday of the month to discuss all things Azure oriented.  Some are deep dive topics on Azure.  Other presentations discuss a topic deeply that may leak over into Azure.  If you are interested in presenting let me know.

[May 20, 2015 &#8211; James Allen &#8211; Infrastructure as Code](http://www.meetup.com/azureaustin/events/221920439/)

James Allen will discuss how to use templates to drive the launching of an Azure environment using json templates and resource manager.

[June 17, 2015 &#8211; Lightning Rounds &#8211; Sign Ups Open!!!](http://www.meetup.com/azureaustin/events/221920588/)

This is a lightning talk session.  5 minutes to talk about what ever cool Azurey thing you like.  Sign ups are currently open.  If you have some cool thing to share with the group let us know.  This is a great format for your first public speaking experience if you are new to this.  Come hang out with us and get a machine gun effect on Azure topics.

## Clear Measure Work Shops

Clear Measure Work Shops are a longer format that is more about hands on keyboards and less about long winded slide show presentations.  These will happen at least once a month on the last saturday of the month.  In these meetings we will spend 20 minutes defining the topic and goal of the day. Then 3 hours actively working towards the goal in a small group (think pair programming) format.  There will be at least one moderator that has experience on the topic being presented to help drive the group towards their goal.  We will be supporting virtual attendees as best we can in these groups.  Virtual attendees will pair with one another.

[April 25, 2015 &#8211; Learn CQRS with Gabriel Schenker](http://www.meetup.com/Clear-Measure-Workshops/events/221702494/)

In this meeting we will discuss a system to build using the CQRS pattern.  Bring your laptops and come prepared to get your fingers dirty banging out some code with your peers!

[May 30, 2015 &#8211; Learn DDD with Justin Self and Jeffrey Palermo](http://www.meetup.com/Clear-Measure-Workshops/events/221920364/)

In this meeting we will discuss a system to build using the DDD pattern.  Bring your laptops and come prepared to get your fingers dirty banging out some code with your peers!

## Want to get involved?

If you are interested in coming to one of these events sign up on meetup.com and RSVP to the event.  If you are interested in presenting a new idea just reach out to me directly and let me know.  I will get you into the schedule.  We need people like you to keep this sort of community event alive!
