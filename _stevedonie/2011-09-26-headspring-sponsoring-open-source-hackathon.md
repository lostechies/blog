In conjunction with [Pablo’s Fiesta](http://lostechies.github.com/fiesta/), an open-space development conference being held in Austin September 30-October 2, Headspring will be sponsoring an Open Source Hackathon at our offices on Sunday October 2nd from 1 PM to 6 PM. Over 150 developers from all over the United States and beyond are coming to Austin for 3 days of ‘sharpening the saw’, and the Los Techies Crew realized that with all that brainpower in one place, we ought to be able to do some concentrated work on the open source tools we all use so much. 

If you’re attending the Fiesta, or even if you aren’t, feel free to come by the [Headspring offices](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=216673471716377895944.0004addc332fc6c2714f3&msa=0&ll=30.389609,-97.744975&spn=0.031133,0.066047) on Sunday to learn more about how open source software is written, ask questions about tools you’re using or would like to use, or even kick-start a new open-source project! Please bring a laptop if you can!
