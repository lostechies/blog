Thanks to all the Los Techies for inviting me to join the group. For those who haven&#8217;t met me, I am software developer and team lead in Austin Texas. I currently work for Drillinginfo, a smallish company that gathers data about the domestic oil and gas industry and then sells it through a subscription-based website. I manage the Data Integration group, consisting of myself and 4 other developers. I&#8217;ve been here about 2 years, and have been working on converting the company from &#8216;slash and burn&#8217; development to a more disciplined Scrum/XP process. 

When I&#8217;m not writing software, I take photos, do woodworking, and play with my kids. I&#8217;ve recently started learning Tae-Kwon-Do with my youngest daughter, which has been really cool.&nbsp;

I have been blogging on and off since 2003 &#8211; first on blogger (<a href="http://stevedonie.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://stevedonie.blogspot.com/</a>)&nbsp;and then on my own server ([Something Pithy](http://donie.endofinternet.org/pebble/Steve "Something Pithy") at http://donie.endofinternet.org/pebble/Steve/ ). At the Austin Tech book club the other day I mentioned that I was having some technical difficulties with my blog, and John invited me to start posting here. I&#8217;m really excited to be a part of this great group of developers.&nbsp;
