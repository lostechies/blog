Just in case you haven&#8217;t heard, the Houston Alt.NET conference is coming up in 2 weeks &#8211; there is still time to register.

Now, I am primarily a&nbsp; Java developer, but I attended the first Alt.NET conference in Austin a couple of years ago, and what was &#8216;sort of&#8217; the 2nd Alt.NET conference in Austin (aka KaizenConf). Both were just awesome events. The people that show up to these sorts of events are all people who are passionate about the craft of software and who take the time out of their lives to be continuous learners. There should always be a balance between work and life &#8211; I believe very strongly in spending lots of time with my family. But if you possibly can, I highly recommend coming. You won&#8217;t be disappointed.
