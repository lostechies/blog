Yep, been a LONG time since I wrote. Gonna try and get back to it now. 

Since I last wrote I have left the Java world and I am now back in the .NET development space. I’m working at Headspring with some awesome people, and after a few weeks on the job I’m starting to remember my .NET skills. Mostly I’ve been working with a client to do a lot of design work. More fun stuff in my next post.
