I am conducting a two day training workshop on Building Maintainable Web Applications.&#160; It will be here in Austin TX June 8-9.

The foundational philosophy I and my consulting company believe is that creating applications that are maintainable starts with creating applications that are easy to test.&#160; This workshop will show you how to apply design and testing techniques to web applications on the ASP.Net Framework.&#160; I am definitely not talking for two days straight, so there will be a lot of hands on experience applying the concepts discussed.

Some of the topics we will be covering include:

  * Designing Applications for Testability
  * Unit Testing Strategies
  * Model View Presenter for ASP.Net WebForms
  * Asp.Net MVC Framework
  * Automated Acceptance Testing of Web Applications
  * Testing JavaScript

The training course is designed for those that have existing ASP.Net 2.0 applications that must extend their lifetime and are also interested in new techniques available, such as the MVC Framework.

The purpose of this training is as much about helping the developer community enhance their skills as anything else.&#160; The cost for the entire 2 day workshop is only $200 so that we can cover our costs.

If you have any questions or would like to attend, please contact me through this blog.
