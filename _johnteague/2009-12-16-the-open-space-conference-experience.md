he [Los Techies Fiesta](http://fiesta.lostechies.com) is shaping up to be a wonderful conference.&#160; We’ve had excellent response with more than 60 people register and quite a few sponsors to help make it even better.&#160; I thought I would take a moment and talk about what it&#8217;s like attending and open space conference.&#160; These are, of course, my experiences and one thing about an Open Space conference is that everyone’s experience will be different.

If you want to learn more, visit the [Open Space wiki](http://www.openspaceworld.org/cgi/wiki.cgi?) to get much better description.

## The Break Room Effect*

If you have ever gone to a conference and had the most amazing, eye opening discussion in the break room between sessions, this is what an OS conference is all day.&#160; It is more about a conversation amongst peers than presentational training (although there could be some of those too).&#160; Most sessions will be ad-hoc conversations </p> 

*I know I stole that line from somewhere, but couldn’t find it again to reference it

## The Schedule

We’ll be following the same schedule that I’ve seen at the few I have been too.&#160; I can’t go into too much detail since I will not be the facilitator.&#160; I’d rather give too little information than incorrect. On Friday we’ll have our opening session where we’ll nominate and vote for topics we find interesting and would like to discuss.&#160; On Saturday we’ll have our breakout session.&#160; As per one of the tenants of Open Space, it’s over when it’s over, there is no timeline for a given topic.&#160; we’ll have spillover rooms setup for conversations that need to continue.&#160; Then on Sunday we’ll have a few wrap up sessions and then close.

## Transformational

I feel that these conferences are a truly transformational event.&#160; Compared traditional conferences where I might learn a lot and (and then quickly forget as I don’t use the knowledge at work), OS conferences offer a chance to really connect with the community and work towards improving myself and the community.

If you haven’t already registered I hope you will.&#160; It is going to be a very fun time and I look forward to meeting everyone who does come.
