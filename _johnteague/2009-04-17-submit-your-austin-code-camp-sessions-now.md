The deadline for submitting session is April 19.&#160; If you want to speak at this year’s code camp, better hurry up.&#160; We have about 27 sessions submitted so far, most of them 2 hours in length.&#160; Also remember, I don’t reject submissions unless I am out of space, which is very unlikely.&#160; So if you submit multiple sessions be prepared to do all of them.

For more details on Submitting Session, check out the original [Call For Speakers](https://lostechies.com/blogs/johnteague/archive/2009/02/17/austin-code-camp-09-call-for-speakeres.aspx).
