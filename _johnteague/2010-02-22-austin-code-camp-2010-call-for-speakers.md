##### &#160;

##### **When:&#160;&#160;&#160; May 15, 2010 – 8:30 AM – 5PM** 

##### **Where:&#160; St. Edwards University Professional Education Center, Austin, TX**

##### ****

The Austin .Net Users Group is hosting its fifth Code Camp. This one day, community driven conference has grown beyond the Austin community to a regional event with attendees from Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas & Oklahoma. Code Camp is _for_ developers _by_ developers, and we need you to help make this year’s event the best ever.

We are looking for presenters and session leaders to help educate the Austin .Net community and beyond. Sessions should be focus on software development practices and techniques that will have an immediate impact. 

### Session Length

To make sure that attendees get the most from your session, the length of the session will not be limited to one hour. Your session can be 1, 2, or 4 hours long. This gives you the freedom to dive deep into your subject matter and allow for discussion and dialog with attendees.

_We encourage you to think outside of the traditional 1 hour presentation format and be creative with your presentation so that attendees have the opportunity to truly comprehend the topic._ 

_In addtion, help your session audience understand the “Why” of your session. Why would I use this feature, technology , or development practice? (e.g. Why should I use ASP.Net&#160; MVC instead of ASP.Net?, or Why should I use the Managed Extensibility Framework – MEF? ). Give you audience a sense of&#160; the “Why” for your session._

### Session formats

**Code focused presentation** – These are presentations that include both a little power point and a lot of code demos. Given the audience that is attending it is important that a large amount of the presentation is focused on code and coding related techniques.

**Chalk Talks / Fish Bowl Discussions** – These sessions are designed as a facilitated discussion around a developer topic. They are presented as a free form facilitated discussion that leverages the expertise of the presenter and the combined knowledge of the group to explore a specific topic.

**Hands-on-labs –** St. Edwards has a computer lab available at the facility, so this gives us the opportunity to explore a hands-on-lab option.

### No Session Tracks

There will be no defined session tracks. Your topic can be on anything you think will interest .Net Developers (even if it’s not about .Net). Topics can include, but are not limited to:

  * **General Development &#8211;** This is a track that discusses general best practices for software development not tied to a specific application library or framework. Possible topics would be design patterns, testing strategies, specific language features (LINQ, generics). 

  * **Smart Client** – This track is designed for topics related to Smart Client related development topics. This includes Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Framework applications, Microsoft Office or mobile devices. 

  * **Web Application** – This track is designed for topics about Web based development that includes ASP.NET, ASP.Net MVC, Silverlight, AJAX, and Web Services. 

  * **Project Management –** This track is designed for presentations and chalk talks that include development process fundamentals and project planning activities such as size estimation, requirements gathering, etc. 

  * **User Experience** &#8212; Covers key disciplines that help bring users directly into your process and reap the rewards of effective, efficient and productive technology solutions, including UX Strategy, Usability Testing, Creative Design, Information Architecture and Design Technology. 

  * **Database/Data Access Technologies &#8211;** ORM’s such as Nhibernate and Entity Framework, WCF Data Services, Linq to SQL, SQLCLR, and ADO.Net.

### Submission Deadline:&#160; March 27, 2010

**<u>Appendix A</u>**. &#8211; Code Camp Manifesto   
<u><http://www.thedevcommunity.org/codecamps/manifesto.aspx></u>

The original Code Camp was a conglomeration of ideas by many different people across the development community. The idea was simple, provide an off hour forum for the development community to speak and share ideas for them to come and enjoy. The results have been astounding. I am happy to report that they are being planned across many different cities. 

###### The question is what makes a Code Camp? 

The answer is actually simple. In order to use the official Code Camp name and banner follow these simple

###### By and For the Developer Community

Code Camps are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.

###### Always Free

Code Camps are always free for attendees.

###### Community Developed Material

The success of the Code Camps is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don&#8217;t want to share or provide to attendees then the Code Camp is not the place for you.

###### No Fluff only Code

Code Camps are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this. 

###### Community Ownership

The most important element of the Code Camp is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.

###### Never occur during work hours

We need to understand that many times people can&#8217;t leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Code Camp is that they always occur on weekends.
