I had the pleasure of speaking at the San Antonio .Net Users Group, aka [Alamo Coders](http://www.alamocoders.net/), this week.&nbsp; We talked about [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) and [Unobtrusive JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript).

Here is the [slide deck](http://www.lostechies.com/files/folders/jcteague/entry4914.aspx).&nbsp; I am going to do the demos as another blog post.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also going to discuss the principles behind Unobtrusive JavaScript as well.
