The 6th Austin Code Camp will be June 9th, 2012 at St Edward&#8217;s Professional Education Center.  It&#8217;s lining up to be a great conference already.  200 people have already registered and we have 30 sessions submitted too.

You can find out more at [http://austincodecamp2012.com](http://austincodecamp2012.com "Austin Code Camp") You can register for the the event and also register as a speaker and submit presentations for the event.

All of the content in community driven, presented by members of the community.   I would encourage you to come and talk about whatever is interesting in the world of software development.  While the event is organized by the Austin .Net Users group, it is not limited to discussions about .Net.   It is an excellent opportunity to gain public speaking experience.

Please come join us!
