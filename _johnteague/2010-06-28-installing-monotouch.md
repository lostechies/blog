I trying out MonoTouch for a few sample apps.&#160; I’m going to log my travails as I go.&#160; I’ve done a few sample Objective-C apps as well, so I should be able to do a compare and contrast between the two as well.&#160; Using Objective-C is really not too bad, but getting used to XCode was really frustrating.&#160; I’m hoping the general development experience will be closer to what I’m accustomed to.

## Installing MonoTouch

Installation was really simple.&#160; The [documentation](http://monotouch.net/Documentation/Installation) is thorough and accurate. Here’s what you need:

  1. iphone sdk, already had this, so I didn&#8217;t do anything 
  2. Install Mono Framework 
      * packaged at as a disk image, very simple at 181MB, bigger than I expected but relatively small compared to the .Net SDK
  3. Install MonoTouch Another 71MB 
  4. Install MonoDevelop &#8212; surprisingly small.

My next task will be the ubiquitous hello world app and compare that to the Native version.&#160; More to come.
