I started a new project at a client site this week.&nbsp; I spent the first couple days on Iteration 0 tasks.&nbsp; These are things you need in place before you can actually get to work.&nbsp; Here are a few things we needed done.

**Source Control**

You absolutely must have some sort of source control.&nbsp; My client happens to be a team of 1, so he wasn&#8217;t using any source control.&nbsp; We set up a subversion repository and the necessary folder structure for the current projects we are working on.

**Build Scripts**

I absolutely hate writing build scripts, but I love executing them.&nbsp; This is just one of those things you&#8217;ve got to suck up and do right at the beginning.&nbsp; You will be executing several times every day when you are working on stories and tasks, so take some time to get them right.&nbsp; For this project, the build scripts were not too complicated. They simply compile the projects and run the unit tests.&nbsp; Normally I would drop and recreate any database that would be used too.&nbsp; In this case, we&#8217;re accessing an existing database, but we are not working on that part yet, so I left it out for now.

**Continuous Integration**

We also set up the CI server.&nbsp; While I really want to try out TeamCity (I tried once with no luck), I stuck with CruiseControl.net.&nbsp; CCNet can be difficult to get right the first time, but again once you get it you can usually forget about it.

We also did some story writing too.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t consider this an Iteration 0 tasks, but is obviously important to have some stories and scenarios ready to go.

What are some of the the Iteration 0 tasks you do before starting a project?
