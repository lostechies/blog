## Pablo&#8217;s Fiesta

#### **Los Techies Open Space Conference on Software Quality & Craftsmanship** 

**When: February 26, 27 & 28   
Where: St. Edward&#8217;s Professional Educational Center, Austin TX**

I am proud to announce the first Los Techies Open Space Conference.&#160; We’ve been working on this for a while we are now finally ready to make the public announcement.

You can see all of the details and register [here](http://fiesta.lostechies.com).&#160; 

### What I want the conference to be.

The great thing about Open Space conferences is that the content as well as the tenor of the conference is defined more by those attending than those who organize it.&#160; Here is what I think the conference should be.&#160; 

The topic of the conference will be focused on Software Quality and Craftsmanship.&#160; This is a topic that is very near and dear to the hearts of the Los Techies crew.&#160; Quality is the most important feature of any product, and can be difficult to achieve and&#160; measure in software.&#160; Craftsmanship is a philosophy about how professionals in our field should approach their work and how, as a profession, we should focus on cultivating a community of software developers who&#160; learn, respect and give back to the profession.

There are several important aspects to being a craftsman that I&#160; to&#160; address:

**Sharpening the Saw**.&#160; It important to learn new techniques and different technologies to continue to grow in this profession. I’m the software developer equivalent of a gear head (or petro head you you UK guys). I have no doubt there will be some technical discussions.

**Multi-Platform**.&#160; I want to talk about more the C#.&#160; Let’s discuss iPhone, Ruby, Python and any other platform that help us become better software developers.

**Selling Quality as a feature**.&#160; How do we convince clients and business executives that quality is a feature of software that has a very big impact on their bottom line.

&#160;

Come to the conference and influence help shape it to be to what you think it should be.&#160; Please join us in Austin TX, February 26,l 27 & 28.
