We are gearing up for This Year&rsquo;s Austin .Net User&rsquo;s Group Code Camp.&nbsp; Last year we had 300 attendees and around 30 sessions.&nbsp; We expect this years to be even better.&nbsp; Register and submit sessions at [www.austincodecamp.com](http://www.austincodecamp.com) (thanks Eric)

### Encouraging Deeper Understanding of Content

In year&rsquo;s past, we followed the traditional session 1 hour presentation format used by most conferences.&nbsp; As I&rsquo;ve attended and speak more conferences, I am finding the one hour session both hindering my ability to adequately learn anything and my ability to deliver quality information. So this year we are doing something a little different.&nbsp; **_Sessions will not be limited to one hour!!!_** Sessions will be 1,2,4 or 6 hours long.&nbsp; Hopefully this will allow you to better comprehend the information being presented instead of being bombarded with new concepts

You can contact me or [Eric Hexter](/blogs/hex/default.aspx) if you have any questions.

See you there!!!

**Please rebroadcast this message as loudly as possible!!**

### What is CodeCamp

<http://www.bostondotnet.org/CodeCamp/default.aspx/CodeCamp/CodeCamp%20Manifesto.html>

#### By and For the Developer Community

Code Camps are about the developer community at large. They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.

#### Always Free

Code Camps are always free for attendees.

#### Community Developed Material

The success of the Code Camps is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction. If you have content you don&#8217;t want to share or provide to attendees then the Code Camp is not the place for you.

#### No Fluff only Code

Code Camps are about showing the code. Refer to rule #1 if you have any questions on this. 

#### Community Ownership

The most important element of the Code Camp is always the developer community. All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment or any other compensation other than their participation in the community.

#### Never occur during work hours

We need to understand that many times people can&#8217;t leave work for a day or two to attend training or even seminars. The beauty of the Code Camp is that they always occur on weekends.
