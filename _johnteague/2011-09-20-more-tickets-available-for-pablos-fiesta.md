The conference sold out about a month ago. Since then we released tickets to everyone on the waitlist. We&#8217;ve released more tickets, so you don&#8217;t have to go on the waitlist right now. I want to make sure that everyone who does want to attend can, so I&#8217;ll try to keep the tickets available up until the cutoff date, which is Sept. 28. So if these tickets sell out, be sure and sign up on the waitlist.
