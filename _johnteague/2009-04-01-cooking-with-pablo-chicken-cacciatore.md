## Ingredients

  * About 1 lb of chicken.&#160; I prefer using thighs or other dark meat, but chicken breast will work too
  * 2 cans of stewed tomatoes.
  * 1 small onion, diced
  * As much garlic as you like, this is a lot for me
  * Fresh Basil
  * Thyme
  * Oregano
  * Salt and Pepper

In a large skillet, brown the chicken in some olive oil over medium heat.&#160; You just need to brown the sides, so 4-5 minutes on each side.&#160; Remove the chicken from the skillet,add the onion and reduce the heat.&#160; Sauté the onion until slightly caramelized.&#160; Then add the tomatoes, garlic, basil, thyme and oregano.&#160; Allow the sauce to simmer for 5 minutes or so, then use a potato masher to crush the tomatoes.&#160; Add the chicken back to the pot and simmer for about 45 minutes or until the chicken is done.&#160; Serve over pasta or rice with grated parmesan cheese.

## Variations

Add mushroom, red peppers or whatever vegetables you like or are handy.

Add about 1/2 cup of dry white wine and reduce for a brighter sauce.
