[Several](/blogs/hex/archive/2009/05/16/austin-code-camp-sessions-voting-results.aspx) [people](/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2009/05/17/austin-codecamp-09-quite-possibly-better-than-bacon.aspx) [have](http://devlicious.com/blogs/anne_epstein/archive/2009/05/17/austin-code-camp-2009.aspx) already mentioned some of the sessions at this year&#8217;s Austin Code Camp. We&#8217;ve [posted the schedule](http://www.adnug.org/austincodecamp09 "Austin Code Camp 09") for people to view.&nbsp; We may move some around depending on how the [voting](http://www.adnug.org/AustinCodeCamp09/Proposal/List "Vote for sessions") goes to make sure there is adequate space for each session.&nbsp; So be sure and check again at the conference.

I&#8217;m really excited about this year&#8217;s line up.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s a good mix of nuts and bolts framework usage and best practices & improving your craft style presentations.

As always, the Austin Code Camp is completely free, including food.&nbsp; We are able to do this by the awesome presenters who volunteer their time deliver this information and to our sponosors who help with actual expenses.

If you haven&#8217;t registered yet, please hurry up and do so. We want to make sure we order enough food for everyone.

I hope to see your there.
