If you’re not already subscribing to the [Google Testing Blog](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/), you should be.&#160; There are some really interesting articles on it.&#160; The latest one takes on if and [when to use Dependency Injection](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2009/01/when-to-use-dependency-injection.html).&#160; I agree with their answer: **yes** and **always!**
