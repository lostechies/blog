I had the opportunity to speak at two code camps in May.&#160; I spoke at the Iowa Code Camp and of course the Austin Code Camp.&#160; I had a great time in Iowa, and no one made fun of my Longhorns shirt the whole time.When I wasn’t presenting I saw some great sessions as well.

## Unobtrusive JavaScript & jQuery Session

We had a really good discussion about UJS and where it applies. The whole point of Unobtrusive JavaScript is to make your sites accessible to the widest possible audience.&#160; Using semantic markup, CSS, and UJS allows you to do that.&#160; Of course jQuery is my library of choice for these types of sites.

## TDD Dojo Session

I did the Dojo at Iowa and and Austin.&#160; The Iowa sessions was,..err, rough around the edges.&#160; The group was a mix of people that had little to no experience with testing and seasoned TDD practitioners. So I had to start from the very beginning and move slowly.&#160; I used the Los Techies Day of TDD materials which probably moves too slow for the length of time I had available.&#160; The seasoned veterans made up for their boredom of the materials by asking me (much welcomed) questions about my day to day TDD practices.&#160; I hope everyone got something out of the conversation and the dojo style of presenting.

When I did the TDD dojo again in Austin, I learned from my mistakes.&#160; I enlisted the help of [Greg Long](http://thatotherguy.lostechies.com). We had about the same mix of people new to unit testing and those with TDD experience.&#160; This time we broke the group up into to groups.&#160; Greg took the introductory dojo and I did the experienced dojo. While the introductory group did the same prepared kata from Day of TDD, we did a [Randoori Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RandoriKata), where nothing was prepared and the group had to come up with a solution to the problem.

I think both times the dojo suffered from from not enough time to get deep enough into the materials.&#160; I really want to do more interactive style of presentations like this, especially at User Group meetings.&#160; I’m just not sure how to compress it even further.

## Deep Dive into Open Closed Principle

The other session at the Austin Code Camp was an in depth look at OCP,patterns to use, and some real world examples.&#160; OCP is like the Nirvana of the Object Oriented Programming.&#160; It takes considerable effort and thought to make your application open for extension, requiring knowledge of other Object Oriented Design principle in order to reach it.&#160; I expanded the talk to include how applying an event driven architecture truly opens up your application to extension.&#160; We had more discussion about this topic than other parts of the talk.&#160; I definitely talk more about EDA.

## Materials

I posted the materials for the Austin Code Camp on the download section of the [google code site](http://code.google.com/p/austin-codecamp-2010/).&#160; I’m also (slowly) putting all of my presentation material at [GitHub](https://github.com/jcteague/presentations) as well.&#160; It doesn’t say this, yet, but all materials are Creative Commons Licensed.
