We&#8217;ve got an amazing line up of presentations this year.  A lot of great people from the community have volunteered their time to share with the rest of what they&#8217;ve learned and what they are passionate about.  With over 40 sessions submitted it&#8217;s going to be a great conference.

The list of proposed sessions are available on the web site [http://austincodecamp2012.com](http://austincodecamp2012.com/). Please look at the sessions and vote for the ones you find most interesting.  We use this information to place the presenations in an appropriately sized room (though some will be cancelled I&#8217;m sure)

It&#8217;s going to be a great conference!

Also if your company would like to sponsor, please contact us.
