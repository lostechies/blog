Thanks to the generous folks, at St. Edwards PEC, the only real cost to organizing our Open Space conference is providing food.&nbsp; This what the $15 registration fee is covering: food, drinks and snacks.

It&rsquo;s important to us that whoever wants to attend shouldn&rsquo;t have to sign corporate expense requests in triplicate and I hope that a $15 registration fee isn&rsquo;t keeping you from coming.

But, if you&rsquo;re like me and really like free or you really don&rsquo;t like conference food, here is a discount code that waives the registration fee.

This discount waives the registration fee and we will not reserve you lunch (we may have extra, but don&rsquo;t count on it). BTW, lunch will be a box lunch with a sandwich & chips.

If you have already registered and would like to use this discount just let me know and I&rsquo;ll give you a refund.

Remember we are capping registration at 150 and we have passed the 90 mark for registered attendees.&nbsp; It is shaping up to be a great time.&nbsp; Please come an join us. 

(funny I just realized that it isn&rsquo;t 09 anymore)
