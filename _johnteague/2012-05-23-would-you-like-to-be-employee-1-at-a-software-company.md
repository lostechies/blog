**Update:** this position is located in Austin.  However if you don&#8217;t live in the area and are interested in working with us, please contact me.  I&#8217;m always interested in working with talented developers no matter where they live!

I&#8217;m expanding my company. I&#8217;m looking to hire a polyglot programmer that is comfortable in C#, JavaScript, Ruby, the best tool for the job.

We&#8217;re a mix of consulting and software products (just starting our first) and you&#8217;ll work with a good group of guys offshore as well. You&#8217;ll be setting the architecture for ours and our clients applications, defining user stories and acceptance criteria and making sure quality stays at an extremely high level. TDD and Agile are required.

Compensation will be salary+equity. Chances are, if you&#8217;re sr. .Net developer, salary will be lower than what you&#8217;re making now. But you&#8217;ll have a lot responsibility, and a life (40 hour work weeks). You&#8217;ll need to be more excited about owning part of the company and making it into something exceptional.

You can contact me through the website, on twitter at @john_teague, or at john at avenidasoftware.com if you are interested.
