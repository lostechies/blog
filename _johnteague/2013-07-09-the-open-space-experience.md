Join us at <a title="Pablo's Fiesta" href="bit.ly/pablosfiesta" target="_blank">Los Techies Fiesta Open Space Conference</a> October 25-27

An Open Space conference is really a different experience than the traditional, presentation driven conference.  While both formats are about learning new things, they go about it in entirely different ways.  While I enjoy both, to me an Open Space conference is more organic and focuses on a free flow of ideas vs a structured lecture.  The way I often describe it is if you&#8217;ve ever gone to a conference and the most stimulating moment was a conversation in the hallway or break room, that&#8217;s an Open Space conference all day long.

The environment is very fluid and active.  This is due to the <a title="Law of Two Feet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Law_of_Two_Feet" target="_blank">Law of Two Feet</a> and  the schedule is determined by the attendees.  Unlike a presentation focused event, where you tend to sit still and listen to someone for an hour or more, you are actively encouraged to move around and keep engaged.  If a session isn&#8217;t going the way you want, just go to another, or start your own.

The self-organizing aspect of the format is really important.  Even though I am one of the organizers of the event, I have almost no say in  what the topics and sessions are about, other than proposing topic I&#8217;m interested in learning mor about.  And the fact that speakers don&#8217;t submit their sessions months in advance, the topics are usually very current and relevant.  For me, the first conference had a lot of conversations about noSql databases and distributed architecture with messaging.  While our second conference had a lot more JavaScript conversations.

What would you like to talk about this year?
