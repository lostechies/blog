I wanted to take a moment and thank the sponsors of&#160; [Pablo’s fiesta open space conference](http://fiesta.lostechies.com).&#160; People and Organizations who sponsor conferences do so because they value their community and use base.&#160; This is especially so for open space conferences since there are very few “formal” presentations with PowerPoint slides and product demos.&#160; We have been very lucky to have a lot support from the Friends of Pablo other companies to keep the cost low enough so the ticket price is not a barrier to attend.

### [St. Edward’s Professional Education Center](http://www.pec.stedwards.edu/)

St. Ed’s PEC has been a great partner for several events in the Austin area.&#160; They have graciously have donated the space for the conference.&#160; Without this donation the ticket cost would be dramatically higher.

### [Microsoft](http://bing.com)

Say what you want for MS, but they have been a great sponsor of community events.&#160; They have helped us with the Austin Code Camp’s and Pablo’s Day of TDD.&#160; It’s nice to have a reliable partner for doing events that are targets community education. Our developer evangelist, [Phil Wheat](http://blogs.msdn.com/PhilWheat) had been very supportive our efforts.
