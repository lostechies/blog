This is the last of a five-part series (sans conclusion) I&rsquo;ve written in response to [this entry by Sean Landis](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=246513).&nbsp; Previous entries in this series are:

The
  
format I have been following is to list the primary pitfall, then toss
  
out some ideas of my own.&nbsp; Without further ado, I&rsquo;ll just jump right
  
back in.

****Pitfall** 10**: Too much power can be granted to the product owner when it comes to steering the product.

**My opinion**:
  
Not a pitfall at all. The product owner MUST steer the product.&nbsp; If
  
there is too much power in the hands of one individual regarding what
  
the product does, that is a business issue not a development issue.&nbsp;
  
The product owner knows their business and what they need.&nbsp; 

The
  
checks and balances regarding how a business operates and how its tools
  
need to behave is not up to the development team.&nbsp; Yes, we should be
  
&ldquo;partners&rdquo; with the business to help provide technology solutions that
  
fulfill a business need. But, we should not be the traffic cops of a
  
business process, or lack thereof.&nbsp; 

Accountability is not
  
erased in Agile development (in fact, one could argue accountability is
  
enhanced); just the methods by which information is shared and revealed
  
has shifted somewhat.&nbsp; If this pitfall displays itself on an Agile
  
team, it would be hard to convince me the issue did not exist under a
  
different process, as well.

****Pitfall** 11**:
  
Agile is too programmer-centric leaving it unclear how to balance work
  
across an organization. There is a need for better documentation and
  
coaching for non-development participants.

**My opinion**:
  
I agree and disagree that this is a pitfall of Agile.&nbsp; In Agile all
  
interested teams are to be intimately involved in the development
  
process all the way through.&nbsp; Yes, this means a lot of people spending
  
time in the development lab (or I.T. department) but a truly Agile team
  
is composed of interested members from all affected disciplines, not
  
just developers.&nbsp; If business users, product owners, business analysts,
  
etc., are not involved along the way that is a result of not properly
  
implementing Agile, not Agile itself.

Coaching for
  
non-development participants is a responsibility of the Agile coach,
  
manager, architect and, yes, even individual developers.&nbsp; If this does
  
not occur, again, it&rsquo;s not because of Agile. It&rsquo;s due to a breakdown in
  
its implementation.

Documentation IS a real issue for some
  
teams.&nbsp; Since having started in Agile development, I have not had to
  
address this problem because my business partners have been satisfied
  
with &ldquo;just enough&rdquo; documentation, so I have limited input to this very
  
real difficulty others face.

What I can say is that [Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)](http://behaviour-driven.org/)
  
is an area to explore in terms of its attempts to shorten/close the gap
  
between requirements gathering and implementation in code.

Agile
  
does not eschew documentation, however.&nbsp; And I think that is one
  
additional misunderstanding.&nbsp; On my teams we still use UML, use cases,
  
wire frames, etc.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just that the expectation of where the final
  
repository of all the information resides shifts to the xUnit test
  
cases and the actual code.&nbsp; Not all business management is comfortable
  
with this and I wish I had an answer for those struggling in this area.

My
  
hope would be that if the product owner, upper management, or whoever
  
is driving the need for something such as an IEEE Software Requirements
  
Specification, will work at understanding the pros and cons of their
  
stance, be willing to relax their position for the good of the project
  
and work at developing a relationship of trust with the development
  
team such that documentation enhances, rather than hinders, the
  
development effort.

**Conclusion**: 

In an
  
earlier post, I spoke about how Agile developers must act like adults
  
(then I went on to layout some thoughts on what I really mean by
  
that).&nbsp; In reality, all participants in the process must do that.&nbsp;
  
Product owners and business partners need to understand Agile core
  
philosophies and be willing to adopt them.&nbsp; It is for their own good:
  
they will get better software than if they don&rsquo;t.

Even though a
  
lot of Agile practices focus on the technical team, Agile really is a
  
social discipline that encompasses everyone with an interest in the
  
final product.&nbsp; When the product owners can understand how important
  
they are to the success of a project, I know the divide between &ldquo;The
  
Business&rdquo; and &ldquo;Development&rdquo; can be bridged.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen it happen.
