So, I offer my final thoughts after responding to [this entry by Sean Landis](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=246513).&nbsp; Previous entries in this series are:

**Philosophy vs Implementation**

Developing
  
software is hard. Developers know that.&nbsp; Product owners, even if they
  
understand that, still may not understand the full implications of that
  
reality. Agile attempts to bridge that gap and does a pretty darn good
  
job, in my humble opinion.&nbsp; 

However, as with all good ideas,
  
philosophy and implementation can be world&rsquo;s apart.&nbsp; Some people
  
criticize Agile as being some sort of Utopian Ideal or non-attainable
  
Nirvana.&nbsp; In conversations I have had, I have made analogies to the
  
essential core of social philosophies that seem to promise a lot but
  
fail to recognize certain realities of humankind.&nbsp; Those very
  
philosophies, with noble and lofty ideals, have often failed in their
  
implementation.&nbsp; But, that does not necessarily mean we abandon the
  
heart of those ideals.

In software we can afford the luxury of
  
pressing on toward the ideal that Agile offers without causing the
  
downfall of a government or social system (at least, I hope so!).&nbsp; We
  
should not just abandon it because it is not perfect, has been
  
misunderstood in the past or has been misapplied with abysmal results
  
somewhere else. There have been tremendously successful software
  
projects that owe their success to Agile and which, in my opinion,
  
would not have been as successful with a more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; approach. 

**Be Agile With Agile**

The
  
fundamental analogy behind Extreme Programming (an Agile variant) is
  
that of driving a car.&nbsp; You get in the car, back out of the drive way
  
and begin heading toward your destination.&nbsp; You have a map, you know
  
where you are going, but along the way you make necessary corrections,
  
keeping your goal in mind.&nbsp; Your steering drifts to the right, you
  
correct; you run into a construction zone, you detour around it &#8211; all
  
the while keeping the goal in mind.&nbsp; 

That is a fitting
  
analogy for our approach toward this broad term, &ldquo;Agile&#8221;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just as we
  
correct ourselves along the way on an Agile project, we could take the
  
same tack with our understanding of Agile itself.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s learn from our
  
mistakes in implementation, continue to refine our understanding of
  
what Agile means, adjust our course along the way and press on toward
  
the goal of writing higher quality software that serves our customers
  
in more efficient and meaningful ways.
