It is with great interest that I read articles and books that deal
  
with the &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; side of Agile development, especially because my
  
current team is in the process of beginning to implement some Agile
  
processes in our environment.&nbsp; The last thing we want is to see our
  
adoption of Agile practices fail.&nbsp; So, we are looking to take &ldquo;what
  
works&rdquo; and implement those things gradually into a system that is
  
ad-hoc right now.&nbsp; 

I appreciate [this blog entry](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=246513)
  
by Sean Landis and write the following in response to and as a
  
continuation of the discussion he started. 

For this entry, I will focus on Sean&rsquo;s first two pitfalls:

**Pitfall 1**:&nbsp; Agile teams may be prone to rapid accumulation of technical debt.

**My opinion**:
  
true.&nbsp; However, that is not the failure of Agile, per se, but rather a
  
failure of the Agile community to sufficiently address this reality.&nbsp;
  
Agile coaches need to be cognizant of this fact (mine was, actually)
  
and stress the importance of putting refactoring work into each
  
iteration or sprint.&nbsp; 

This will diverge from &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Agile in
  
the sense that a refactoring story does not provide a business
  
deliverable.&nbsp; But, just as in traditional (or dare I say, &ldquo;legacy&rdquo;)
  
methodologies, the business customer needs to understand the importance
  
of addressing technical work that must be done in support of the final
  
product.&nbsp; 

Maybe I have misunderstood, but isn&rsquo;t one fundamental philosophy of Agile the idea
  
that we adjust our activities to fit changing needs?&nbsp; Heck, Agile
  
itself might need to be Agile here: adjust itself to deal with the
  
reality of technical debt.&nbsp; Hint: take a look at Scrum.

With that being said, here comes The Big But: part of what Agile is about is craftsmanship.&nbsp; In fact I&#8217;d have to say that craftsmanship is a driving aspect of Agile and underpins some of its core practices, leading us to fantasize about the elimination of technical debt.&nbsp; Principles like S.O.L.I.D., Clean Code, etc., though their constituent parts have been around in some form long before Agile, are key components of at least my understanding of Agile.&nbsp; For me, it is those principles <span style="text-decoration: underline">within the context of Agile</span> that are so compelling. And these principles, practiced in concert with techniques such as Test-Driven Development and Continuous Integration, push us closer to the ideal of eliminating technical debt.&nbsp; Until we reach that perfect state of being, however, we do need to address the reality of technical debt in such a way as to repeatedly and continually produce working software.

****Pitfall** 2**: Successful Agile development presupposes team members will all act like adults.

**My opini**on:
  
true.&nbsp; However, I really think this is a selling point of Agile, not a
  
pitfall (of course, it depends on your audience).&nbsp; Shouldn&rsquo;t we all act
  
like adults whether we&rsquo;re developing software, drilling for oil or
  
serving hamburgers?&nbsp; 

Some of the things I think acting like an adult means:

  * Letting go of arrogance, impatience and condescension.&nbsp; 
  * Doing what you&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;ll do 
  * Taking responsibility to be the best you can be 
  * Making a commitment to lifelong learning and personal growth 
  * Doing your best today, realizing that tomorrow you&rsquo;ll be better 
  * Helping others who aren&rsquo;t as good, smart, talented or knowledgeable as you, without being arrogant or cocky.&nbsp; 
  * Taking pride in your work and assuming others are doing the same, until proven otherwise. 
  * Taking pride in accomplishments to date, but being open to learning from someone who has accomplished more 
  * Knowing your limitations, working to stretch beyond them but being willing to ask for help when necessary 

Agile
  
&ldquo;suffers&rdquo; from this pitfall because the world suffers from this
  
malady.&nbsp; The controls that other methodologies have to deal with this
  
very fact of human existence are not any more effective than the
  
emphasis on personal responsibility Agile embraces.&nbsp; 

On a good
  
team, Agile is self-correcting: the transparency required, the pairing,
  
etc., all tend to place social pressure on those individuals that are
  
not &ldquo;cutting the mustard.&rdquo;&nbsp; They either get better or end up leaving
  
the team because they can&rsquo;t stand the scrutiny.&nbsp; 

Maybe Agile is actually quite effective at making sure we all behave like adults.&nbsp; Is that really a bad thing?

**Conclusion**

I&rsquo;m
  
really just pitching my two-cents out there for consideration.&nbsp; Next I
  
will throw my feeble mind at Pitfalls three, four and five.&nbsp; If anything
  
sparks ideas, views, opinions, contrary or not, please feel free to
  
respond.
