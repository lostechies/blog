I continue tossing my obtuse bits into cyberspace here, as a follow-up to the previous three entries:

  * [Part One](/blogs/agilecruz/archive/2009/02/10/part-one-a-response-to-traps-amp-pitfalls-of-agile-development-a-non-contrarian-view.aspx) 
  * [Part Two](/blogs/agilecruz/archive/2009/02/10/part-two-a-response-to-traps-amp-pitfalls-of-agile-development-a-non-contrarian-view.aspx) 
  * [Part Three](/blogs/agilecruz/archive/2009/02/10/part-three-a-response-to-traps-amp-pitfalls-of-agile-development-a-non-contrarian-view.aspx) 

This series is being written in response to [Sean Landis&rsquo; this blog entry](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=246513).&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get right back to it&#8230;

****Pitfall** 7**:
  
Agile can be hard on the product owner who has a lot of
  
responsibility&#8230;<snip>&hellip;This role can become a bottleneck
  
because it is unable to &#8220;feed&#8221; the development team fast enough.

**My opinion**:
  
true.&nbsp; But, pardon me if I am being too blunt: they want the product so
  
shouldn&rsquo;t they be willing to put in the time and energy to make sure
  
they get what they need?&nbsp; And if they are not motivated enough to do
  
what is necessary to support the development of their product, maybe
  
they ought to question the exigency of the software request in the
  
first place?

One of the primary problems Agile attempts to
  
address is the lag time between requirements and working software so
  
the product owner can see very quickly how the developers are
  
implementing their understanding of the business needs.&nbsp; 

Better
  
that the owner take the time now to help the developers adjust to
  
changing business needs or misunderstood requirements than to wait 6,
  
12, 24, 36 months to find out the product has more problems than
  
solutions.&nbsp; That will be much less costly, both in true costs and
  
opportunity costs, than waiting until The Big Day to find out things
  
aren&rsquo;t working as expected. 

Of course, it is easy to write
  
this.&nbsp; Not necessarily so easy for the product owner to do.&nbsp; This is
  
why upper management support of Agile is critical (it you&rsquo;re working in
  
a larger company).&nbsp; They will have the commitment and authority to
  
allocate the resources needed.&nbsp; Remember, an Agile team consists of a
  
LOT more than just developers.

****Pitfall** 8**: Agile is over-hyped, thus leading to unrealistic expectations.

**My opinion**: true, kind of. For starters, see my response to [Pitfall 3 in this post](http://agilecruz.blogspot.com/2009/01/response-to-traps-pitfalls-of-agile_07.html).&nbsp; 

The
  
main point I&rsquo;d like to make here, as with several other pitfalls, this
  
may be true but is not exclusive to Agile.&nbsp; Rather it is a result of
  
how well Agile speaks to our needs as software professionals.

I
  
remember several other methodologies that, in their heyday, suffered
  
from the same criticism: the Rational Unified Process, for example.&nbsp;
  
This does not mean some of their techniques were irrelevant.&nbsp; Rather, I
  
see the hype that surrounded some of these as evidence the aims of each
  
methodology spoke to issues at the heart of pain in many people&rsquo;s
  
experience with building software; and, thus, it was easy to glom on to
  
a new technique with fervor in hopes that FINALLY the pain point will
  
be eliminated.&nbsp; 

Let me also add that we, as Agile developers,
  
coaches, managers, architects, etc., have a responsibility to
  
realistically communicate the benefits of Agile in a way that does not
  
set unrealistic expectations.&nbsp; Agile will hold its own if we approach
  
it with a level head.&nbsp; Agile effectively addresses most common software
  
development pain points but it is NOT a silver bullet.&nbsp; We must be
  
careful to give the proper impression when advocating for it.

****Pitfall** 9**: A variation of The Blame Game can arise.

**My opinion**:
  
This is absolutely true, and I wish I had an answer for this.&nbsp; The
  
characteristics that describe an Agile team are not always found in the
  
organization as a whole.&nbsp; 

The approach I have taken is to let
  
others know up front, in a non-threatening way, that if the project is
  
developed as efficiently as we hope, they may need some help in
  
adjusting their processes, too.&nbsp; That way I attempt to defuse the blame
  
early by letting others know they might see throughput issues outside
  
of development.&nbsp; I try to paint this in a good light: we&rsquo;re all
  
interested in the same end goal and shifting bottle necks are natural,
  
so don&rsquo;t be alarmed.&nbsp; So far, I have avoided the blame game.

**Conclusion**:

For
  
many folks, Agile turns traditional and well-loved, if dysfunctional,
  
processes on their heads.&nbsp; We cannot forget how high the stakes are for
  
some of our customers and how important we are in helping them meet
  
their business goals.

Let us be patient as we can with the
  
business/product owners, working to help them understand that the
  
quality of our deliverable will be proportional to everyone&rsquo;s
  
willingness to invest time in the process.&nbsp; Let us be careful to
  
communicate clearly with the product owners and set realistic
  
expectations, regardless of methodology.&nbsp; 

And if Agile
  
reveals a bottleneck in a business process 3 steps removed from the
  
developers, isn&rsquo;t that a good thing?&nbsp; Hopefully, we can help prepare
  
our organization for that eventuality, receiving buy-in up front and,
  
thus, reducing negative political fallout.&nbsp; I realize that is not not
  
always possible, but let us aspire to that Ideal and continue working
  
to mature the process.
