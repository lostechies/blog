<p>Hola Amigos!</p>

<p>LosTechies.com was originally discussed a few years ago, over a couple of adult beverages whose name sounds very similar to Los tEquies. Anyway the thought was to create a public forum where technical ideas and thoughts can be shared in the same way we all get together around a good meal and drinks. Ideas and thoughts are cultivated in discussion, and brought to fruition through professional debate and laughter. Sounds good in theory, well read our thoughts and ideas, take part in our debates and rejoice in our laughter.</p>
