Sorry all, I&#8217;ll probably be over this JavaScript tear soon enough, but now that I&#8217;ve given the language another glance it has really caught my eye this time.&nbsp; I can only explain my recent engagement with the language as a total re-discovery.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve done some js OO before in the past, but looking at the language completely outside of a web development context has really helped my make a paradigm shift.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been kind of like when I was scripting in sed then discovered perl.


  


Here&#8217;s a really good js article: <http://simon.incutio.com/slides/2006/etech/javascript/js-reintroduction-notes.html>


  


&nbsp;I couldn&#8217;t agree more with the author, Simon Willison,&nbsp;when he says &#8220;&#8230;JavaScript has a reasonable claim to being the world&#8217;s most misunderstood programming language.&#8221;&nbsp; 


  


Again, the author focuses on js from a web developer viewpoint, but I really think its potential is undervalued when it comes to using the language as a tool for system tools.&nbsp; I just have to find a better way of managing script libraries&#8230;
