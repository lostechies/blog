First off, I&#8217;m not much of a blogger so I&#8217;m not quite up to speed on the tips and trick of blogging.&nbsp; I saw recently pretty pictures in one of Nellie&#8217;s blogs and was instanly green with envy.&nbsp; I wanted pictures too!&nbsp; I tinkered around with the dashboard and blog editor for a while to no avail and finally out of desparation&nbsp;went back&nbsp;his blog entry.&nbsp; I noticed WindowsLiveWriter in the URL and gave a quick search.&nbsp; To say the least, I wish I was aware of the tool in the first place.&nbsp; It facilitates creating blog entries easily with rich content.&nbsp; Just as a simple example, I&#8217;ve included and image of one of the more lackluster constellations, Triangulum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;now I can include screen shots in discussions&#8230;.yiiiihaaa!
