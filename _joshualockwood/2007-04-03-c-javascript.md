Joe had asked me recently if I thought I might want to make a tool that compiles C# into JavaScript.&nbsp; I might want to futs with something like that, but fortunately I don&#8217;t have to any time soon.&nbsp; There&#8217;s already a tool called script# that does just that.&nbsp; This is a pet project of Nikhil Kothari and is definitely a must see.&nbsp; I plan on messing with this in the near future with the goal of covering client code with nunit testing and rendering&nbsp;the business rules related client side scripts during the build.
