How very rude of me, looking back I forgot to mention I&#8217;ve joined [Los Techies](http://www.lostechies.com/Default.aspx).&nbsp; A few things drew me to joining:

  * Name sounds very similar to a [certain cerveza](http://www.dosxx.com) 
      * The promise of a free [T-Shirt](https://www.cafepress.com/lostechies) 
          * Being part of a community is important to me, and the shadier the better 
              * My continuing&nbsp;quest to lower the bar wherever I go 
                  * Peer intimidation factor lowered by lack of [MVPs](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/), unlike [other communities](http://codebetter.com/)</ul> 
                My feed URL&nbsp;will stay&nbsp;the same ([https://feeds.feedburner.com/GrabBagOfT](https://feeds.feedburner.com/GrabBagOfT "https://feeds.feedburner.com/GrabBagOfT")), and I&#8217;ll cross-post&nbsp;between the two sites as Google seems to&nbsp;like the&nbsp;Blogspot site. I&#8217;ll continue to respond to comments on each as well.&nbsp; However, I&#8217;d recommend additionally subscribing to the community feed ([http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/MainFeed.aspx](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/MainFeed.aspx "http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/MainFeed.aspx")).&nbsp; You&#8217;ll have access to a&nbsp;greater&nbsp;breadth and depth of&nbsp;content than I could ever hope to create.
