Since the one AutoMapper blog post comment section is a terrible place to ask and answer questions, I created an AutoMapper-users Google Group:

[http://groups.google.com/group/automapper-users](http://groups.google.com/group/automapper-users "http://groups.google.com/group/automapper-users")

I was probably being a little presumptuous that there are user(s) plural other than me, but hey, I can dream.&#160; That’s the best place to ask questions and submit patches.

I’m working on samples and better documentation, but given my track record with NBehave, we’ll see how that goes.
