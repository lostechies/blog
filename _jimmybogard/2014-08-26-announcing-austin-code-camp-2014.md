It’s that time of year again to hold our annual Austin Code Camp, hosted by the [Austin .NET User Group](http://adnug.org/):

[Austin 2014 Code Camp](http://codecamp14.adnug.org/)

We’re at a [new location](http://codecamp14.adnug.org/location.html) this year at New Horizons Computer Learning Center Austin, as our previous host can no longer host events. Big thanks to [St. Edwards PEC](http://www.pec.stedwards.edu/) for hosting us in the past!

[Register for Austin Code Camp](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/austin-code-camp-2014-tickets-12769815863)

We’ve got links on the site for schedule, registration, sponsorship, location, [speaker submissions](http://codecamp14.adnug.org/speakers.html) and more.

Hope to see you there!

And because I know I’m going to get emails…

### Charging for Austin Code Camp? Get the pitchforks and torches!

In the past, Austin Code Camp has been a free event with no effective cap on registrations. We could do this because the PEC had a ridiculous amount of space and could accommodate hundreds of people. With free registration, we would see 50% drop-off attending from registrations. Not very fun to plan food with such uncertainty!

This year we have a good amount of space, but not infinite space. We can accommodate the typical number of people that come to our Code Camp (150-175), but for safety reasons we can’t put an unlimited cap on registrations as we’ve done in the past.

Because of this, we’re charging a small fee to reserve a spot. It’s not even enough to cover lunch or a t-shirt or anything, but it is a small enough fee to ensure that we’re fair to those that truly want to come.

Don’t worry though, if you can’t afford the fee, send me an email, and we can work it out.
