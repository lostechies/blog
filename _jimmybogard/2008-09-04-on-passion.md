One of my favorite bloggers, [JP Boodhoo](http://www.jpboodhoo.com/Home.oo), has a little saying he puts at the end of every post:

> Develop with passion!

I&#8217;ve only met JP once, and it was quite obvious from that meeting that passion is somewhat of a mantra for him.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also something the best career counselor offered me years ago: &#8220;Find what you&#8217;re passionate about, and do that&#8221;.&nbsp; When it comes to passion and programming professionally, I&#8217;ve seen two types of passion:

  * Passion for the craft
  * Passion for the domain

I&#8217;ve met far too many programmers that have passion, but only for the craft.&nbsp; When the business would ask for some feature, their passion would lead to a technically interesting solution, but one that may or may not have solved the original problem.&nbsp; This could be solved with deeper analysis of course, but what would lead that developer towards deeper analysis?&nbsp; What motivates them to do so?&nbsp; If all the developer is looking for is [technical success](https://lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2008/08/19/on-good-design-and-defining-success.aspx), they will only reluctantly care about the domain problem, and only enough to get back to the technical problems.

We&#8217;ve all been guilty of this at one time or another.&nbsp; Twisting requirements, hedging estimates to make a fun technical solution turn into a no-brainer business decision.&nbsp; We&#8217;re doing a great disservice to our employers with these actions.&nbsp; I believe this strong motivation comes from a lack of passion for the domain.

One pattern I&#8217;ve started to notice lately is that **continued success requires passion**.&nbsp; Without passion comes little sustained success.&nbsp; Short-term success may come by accident, but it&#8217;s far easier to be unlucky in success than it is lucky.

When we apply our passion, we can&#8217;t put all of our eggs in the technical basket.&nbsp; Domain-driven design talks quite a bit about the Ubiquitous Language, and how it is important for developers and domain experts to share the same language.&nbsp; This language needs to come from the domain, not technical patterns and such.&nbsp; **Without passion for the domain, our organization will never achieve complete success**.

When we&#8217;re in conversations with the business analysts about specific stories, working through the motivation behind the story, passion for the domain creates a two-way conversation.&nbsp; Otherwise, it&#8217;s two people speaking different languages, trying and failing to translate in and out of technical mumbo-jumbo. &#8220;So you want to use an ESB for that?&#8221; &#8220;All I want is to not have to work these orders manually&#8221; &#8220;So you want an ERP system?&#8221; &#8220;What?&#8221;

Eventually the business analyst caves to technical demands, hoping that they solve the business problem at hand.&nbsp; Since they aren&#8217;t the technical expert, the BA puts their trust in the developer.&nbsp; Without passion for the domain, their trust is truly misplaced.

I truly believe it is a developer&#8217;s job to bridge the gap between technology and business.&nbsp; Success in bridging this gap requires both passion for the craft and passion for the domain.
