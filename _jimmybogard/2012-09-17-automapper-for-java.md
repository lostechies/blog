Every once in a while, I get a request asking if there’s anything like AutoMapper for the Java platform. For a long time, that answer was “no”. Not anymore!

[Jonathan Halterman](http://jodah.org/) got in touch with me almost 2 years ago about any kind of AutoMapper-like tools in Java, didn’t like what he saw, and instead built a tool called [ModelMapper](http://modelmapper.org/). Note – this isn’t a port of AutoMapper, it’s a re-imagining of what AutoMapper does, optimized for the Java platform.

Check it out!
