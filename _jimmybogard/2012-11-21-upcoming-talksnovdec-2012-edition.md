I’m going to be traveling a bit after Thanksgiving to Dublin, London, and Kiev. I like to try and do something with the local community folks (mostly because I enjoy foreign ales). If you’re around, come by and say hello! Or “dia dhuit”, “all right”, “Привiт/Привет” (Ukrainian/Russian spelling seems different).

  * [Thursday, November 29th – Dublin ALT.NET](http://dublinalt.net/2012/11/20/november-meetup-jimmy-bogard-on-real-world-polyglot-persistence/) – Real world polyglot persistence (free event)
  * [December 4-7 – Enterprise Development with NServiceBus @ SkillsMatter](http://skillsmatter.com/course/design-architecture/udi-dahan-nservicebus-workshop) (4-day course)
  * [Tuesday, December 4th – SkillsMatter “In the Brain” session](http://skillsmatter.com/event/open-source-dot-net/real-world-polyglot-persistence) – Real world polyglot persistence (free event)

I don’t have anything planned for Kiev just yet – maybe just an ALT.NET beers or something.

Hope to see you there!
