I consider one of the measures of quality of a book to be the number of personal assumptions challenged by its material.&nbsp; To that point, Gerard Meszaros&#8217; [xUnit Test Patterns](http://xunitpatterns.com/) did not disappoint.

Perhaps the biggest assumption was a dogmatic view of what a unit test should look like without compromise.&nbsp; There are benefits and liabilities to any choice made on test strategy, structure, organization, direction, and others.&nbsp; Having options leads to making informed decisions instead of blindly following habits.&nbsp; Looking back at my personal testing strategy over the past years, I fear I may have fallen into the latter.

Some of the major items I look to implement include:

  * Rigor in addressing test smells
  * Fitting the strategy to the situation, and not choosing a one-size-fits-all approach
  * Allowing myself to refactor tests (to fix such test smells)
  * Trying different organization styles

Part of the reason of the [Fowler Signature Series&#8217;](http://martinfowler.com/books.html) success I believe comes in its organization.&nbsp; While the length of xUnit Test Patterns seems daunting at first (833 pages!), it&#8217;s actually composed of two books.&nbsp; This is what Martin Fowler refers to as a [Duplex Book](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DuplexBook.html).

The first part consists of a set of narratives and tutorials, and makes up less than 200 pages.&nbsp; The rest of the book focuses on patterns and reference material.&nbsp; The first part can be read straight through, while the second can be referred to as needed.&nbsp; While I carefully read the first section, it didn&#8217;t take longer than a Saturday afternoon to get through.&nbsp; The rest of the book I&#8217;ll probably get to as I come up against specific situations and smells.

For those that are:

  * New to unit testing
  * Old pros to unit testing
  * Completely oblivious to unit testing

You&#8217;d do yourself (and your team and employer) a great service by giving xUnit Test Patterns a go.&nbsp; If you wind up hating it, well, it&#8217;s big enough to make a fantastic door stop.
