Left unchecked, Visual Studio tends to get very cluttered:

I found I don&#8217;t use any of these icons.&nbsp; Copy, Cut, Paste, Undo, Redo?&nbsp; Those are all keyboard shortcuts.&nbsp; Comment and Uncomment?&nbsp; Ctrl+K+C, Ctrl+K+U.&nbsp; Save All?&nbsp; Ctrl+Shift+S.

No more, I&#8217;m going lean.&nbsp; None of these toolbars provided me value, taking up valuable screen real estate, so I got rid of them all:

That&#8217;s about 80 pixels I saved, and about 5 more lines of code are visible.&nbsp; Beyond that, I&#8217;m no longer distracted by a hundred little icons, each hoping they&#8217;ll be clicked juuuuust once to prove their worth.
