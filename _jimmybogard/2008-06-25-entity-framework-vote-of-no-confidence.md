As was [announced initially](http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/06/23/ado-net-enity-framework-vote-of-no-confidence.aspx) (as far as I can tell) on Bil Simser&#8217;s blog, some concerned citizens of the .NET world put out an online vote-of-no-confidence concerning the Entity Framework:

  * [Letter](http://efvote.wufoo.com/forms/ado-net-entity-framework-vote-of-no-confidence/)
  * [List of signatories](http://efvote.wufoo.com/reports/entity-framework-vote-of-no-confidence-signatories/#public)

Somewhere on the list you&#8217;ll find my name.&nbsp; I agree with the letter, and I encourage you to read the letter and sign if you also agree.&nbsp; I also have two additional reasons I signed:

  * I got totally hosed by the initial MSDN documentation on data access, when I was getting started on programming
  * The overall direction and strategy towards data access hasn&#8217;t seemed to change since then

Using DataSets and typed DataSets, complete with all my logic inside stored procedures, seemed bad, but I didn&#8217;t know any better.&nbsp; Why should I?&nbsp; The articles from the folks who created the framework described in great detail the correct way to use their framework.

But people who write articles aren&#8217;t always the same as the people who develop real-world applications.&nbsp; Now, I don&#8217;t pretend to know how the design process works, they can&#8217;t be completely in a vacuum, but I&#8217;m not sure how much opportunity people developing frameworks get to build applications built on top of those frameworks.

When you don&#8217;t live in the house you built, you have to rely on the current inhabitants to tell you the house works.&nbsp; Unless said inhabitants have only known houses where the toilet sits inside the kitchen, they&#8217;ll probably ask for a closer fridge.

There have already been quite a few reactions from bloggers (thank you Google):

The goal of this letter is to inform customers, as well as create more dialog.&nbsp; I believe this letter will be successful on both points.
