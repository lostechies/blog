Last week I was lucky enough to speak at [ThatConference](http://www.thatconference.com/) – now the other awesome developer conference hosted at a Kalahari Resort. The week was a blast and I highly recommend penciling in next year’s dates to go.

I talked about functional testing in ASP.NET MVC – showing how regular unit tests don’t cover what we want, but coded UI tests can be rather brittle. The slides/code can be found at my [github](https://github.com/jbogard/presentations).

Enjoy!
