One of the more tiring arguments against ideas like Agile or Lean is the line of “gee, it used to be RUP, now Agile, now Lean.&#160; Make up your mind!&#160; I’ll come back in 2 years when it’s something else shiny you’ve latched onto.”&#160; But that’s not an argument against ideas, it’s just an argument against change.

If my code today isn’t better than it was 6 months ago, I’m doing something wrong.

If my ideas on how to best develop and deliver software haven’t changed in the last 2 years, I’m doing something wrong.

You know that thing when your ideas change over time, due to experience and new knowledge?&#160; It’s called learning.&#160; And if you’re not continuously learning, challenging your biases and beliefs, you’re not staying static, you’re falling behind.

I’ve been guilty in the past of putting ideas on a golden throne (time-boxed iterations) without really challenging them or looking at other options.&#160; But a person changing their mind isn’t an valid argument against their ideas, it’s a logical fallacy.

So we have two options – cling to what we know and understand for as long as there is a market for that expertise, or, continuously learn and grow.
