[Jeremy Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/) [mentioned](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/08/06/fred-george-is-blogging.aspx) that [Fred George](http://processpeoplepods.blogspot.com/) is blogging now, and that he&#8217;d be worth reading.&nbsp; Wow, Jeremy wasn&#8217;t lying.&nbsp; One of the first posts really resonated with me, on [collocation](http://processpeoplepods.blogspot.com/2007/07/collocate-to-communicate-part-1.html).&nbsp; I&#8217;ve now had the opportunity to work in a variety of different office types:

  * Individual offices 
      * Shared room, facing&nbsp;walls 
          * Shared room, facing each other, away from walls 
              * Cubes</ul> 
            It&#8217;s something I noticed but couldn&#8217;t quite quantify or measure at the time, but collocation had a drastic positive effect on our team communication.&nbsp; Basically, if I have to stand up and walk to talk to someone, it&#8217;s not going to happen very often.&nbsp; If I don&#8217;t even need to turn my head to have a conversation, communication happens all the time.
            
            Since most inefficiencies I encounter during work are because of a lack&nbsp;of communication, it follows that we should optimize our environment for communication.
            
            #### A rough measurement
            
            So how many conversations did I have per day given each office type?&nbsp; This is based purely on my recollection, so obviously it&#8217;s skewed and a bit off, but here&#8217;s what I remember:
            
            <table cellpadding="2" width="496">
              <tr>
                <td width="266">
                  <strong>Office Type</strong>
                </td>
                
                <td width="223">
                  <strong>Conversations per day</strong>
                </td>
              </tr>
              
              <tr>
                <td width="266">
                  Individual office
                </td>
                
                <td width="223">
                  1-3
                </td>
              </tr>
              
              <tr>
                <td width="266">
                  Shared room, facing walls
                </td>
                
                <td width="223">
                  20-25
                </td>
              </tr>
              
              <tr>
                <td width="266">
                  Shared room, facing each other, away from walls
                </td>
                
                <td width="223">
                  50-60
                </td>
              </tr>
              
              <tr>
                <td width="266">
                  Cubes
                </td>
                
                <td width="223">
                  5-10
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            
            When it came to the shared rooms, I had to estimate in conversations per hour, because communication happens so often.&nbsp; When I was pairing, it was a continuous conversation, so I&#8217;d have to start measuring in length instead of number.&nbsp; Even when I wasn&#8217;t pairing, I would get involved with maybe a dozen conversations per hour.
            
            Communication is also something that training can only take so far.&nbsp; If the training is working against what the environment naturally encourages, the success rate isn&#8217;t going to be too high.
            
            #### Tweaking the environment
            
            When I was in a shared room, facing walls, our setup looked something like this: (apologies for the crude drawing)
            
            [<img style="cursor:pointer;cursor:hand" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_poAbnIVuAzE/RrsxyOUQFTI/AAAAAAAAABM/Er6iQhrMamo/s400/room+orig.JPG" border="0" />](http://bp1.blogger.com/_poAbnIVuAzE/RrsxyOUQFTI/AAAAAAAAABM/Er6iQhrMamo/s1600-h/room+orig.JPG)
            
            We had several issues with this layout:
            
              * People talked to each other without looking anyone in the eye (losing valuable visual communication) 
                  * No wall space for whiteboards&nbsp; 
                      * People usually only talked to those in their immediate vicinity 
                          * Those on the left never heard those on the other side of the room</ul> 
                        I should point out that our room wasn&#8217;t this small, it does look a bit cramped in there in my drawings.&nbsp; To address these issues, we played around with our desks until we arrived&nbsp;at our final layout:
                        
                        [<img style="cursor:pointer;cursor:hand" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_poAbnIVuAzE/Rrsx9eUQFUI/AAAAAAAAABU/zDt70I8UTSw/s400/room+after.JPG" border="0" />](http://bp2.blogger.com/_poAbnIVuAzE/Rrsx9eUQFUI/AAAAAAAAABU/zDt70I8UTSw/s1600-h/room+after.JPG)
                        
                        We found several advantages with this layout:
                        
                          * Everyone was facing each other 
                              * Everyone could hear all conversations and jump in if needed 
                                  * Wall space was freed up for whiteboards, to put up status, do some modeling, etc. 
                                      * Whiteboards were visible to everyone in the group 
                                          * We became a more cohesive, trusting team</ul> 
                                        The biggest impact was the last point, since **communication builds trust**. With trust in place, we can achieve true shared responsibility, and finger pointing was reduced to almost nil.&nbsp; If finger pointing did happen, the entire team knew about it and recognized&nbsp;the problem,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;would come up and get resolved&nbsp;in our next daily stand-up.
                                        
                                        As one of the biggest Agile values is communication, collocation is absolutely essential in building a smooth running Agile team.&nbsp; Without collocation, the Agile team can become fractured, distant, and slip back in to the siloed, deferred responsibility paradigm that waterfall processes enforce.
