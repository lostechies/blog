Big thanks to [Jeffrey](http://jeffreypalermo.com/) for getting this going:

<http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project13>

What made it much easier was that I used [TreeSurgeon](http://treesurgeon.codeplex.com/) as a starting place for builds.&#160; NAnt isn’t the dirt easiest thing to get going from scratch, so TreeSurgeon’s tree and build creator made things a snap.

Pretty sweet.
