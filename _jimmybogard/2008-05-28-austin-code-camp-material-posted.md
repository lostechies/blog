I&#8217;ve (finally) posted my slides and code from Austin Code Camp:

  * [Intro to C# 3.0](http://grabbagoftimg.s3.amazonaws.com/Intro to CSharp 3.0.zip)
  * [Mocks and Stubs](http://grabbagoftimg.s3.amazonaws.com/LegacyCode.zip)
  * [Legacy Code](http://grabbagoftimg.s3.amazonaws.com/MocksAndStubs.zip)

All code includes before and after solutions, along with descriptive comments on the changes made (and why).

The slides aren&#8217;t too interesting, as most of the slide notes contain a line-for-line transcription of the classic Mel Brooks movie, Spaceballs.&nbsp; If things went bad during my presentations, my backup plan was to perform a solo reenactment of the entire film.

Luckily for the audience, the presentations weren&#8217;t a complete disaster.

If you have any questions about any of the material, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.
