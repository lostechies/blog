Ever notice that little red bar show up sometimes in while coding in&nbsp;Visual Studio 2005?&nbsp; It shows up after making certain changes to code, such as renaming methods, fields, or types that need to be imported:

That little red bar (did you miss it?&nbsp; Look closer!)&nbsp;brings&nbsp;up a helpful context menu that has some nice refactorings/editing commands.&nbsp; Unfortunately, to&nbsp;get the menu to show up with your mouse, you have to bring the mouse down&nbsp;from above onto that&nbsp;little bar that&#8217;s about 10 pixels wide.

That&#8217;s extremely annoying,&nbsp;and I&#8217;ve often&nbsp;missed many times trying to hit that little bar.&nbsp; Couple that with the fact I don&#8217;t like to use the mouse while coding, and it&#8217;s even more annoying.

Luckily, VS 2005&nbsp;has a nice shortcut combination to&nbsp;bring that menu up: **Ctrl+.**&nbsp; After that combo, the menu shows up:

Now you can just hit &#8220;Enter&#8221; and it performs the highlighted command.&nbsp; For ReSharper users, **&#8220;Ctrl+.&#8221; is to&nbsp;Visual Studio as&nbsp;&#8220;Alt+Enter&#8221; is&nbsp;to ReSharper**.&nbsp; I&#8217;m probably the last person to know this shortcut, but it&#8217;s nice for the few times I prefer Microsoft&#8217;s helper menu over ReSharper&#8217;s.
