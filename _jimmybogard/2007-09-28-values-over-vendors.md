Many times when I start explaining Scrum or Agile for the first time, one of the first questions I get asked is &#8220;what tool do I use for <project function>&#8221;?&nbsp; I fully understand needing to standardize on a platform such as .NET, Java, RoR, etc.&nbsp; But **how** you deliver&nbsp;shouldn&#8217;t be&nbsp;nearly as important to the business as **what** you deliver.

One of the most important aspects of true Agile teams is a self-organizing team, which determines how best to deliver and develop what the business needs.&nbsp; If the business can&#8217;t trust the team to choose **how**, how in the world can the business trust them to deliver anything at all?

A self-organizing team cultivates a set values, principles, and practices to deliver software.&nbsp; The values come first, and everything else is built on top of that.&nbsp; If you start with tools and try to fit values around the tools, you&#8217;ll find the team is only going to care about fulfilling the corporate policy and much less about the value behind the tool.&nbsp; It&#8217;s far easier to build policies on values than to derive values from policies, as policies built without values will seem arbitrary and pointless to the team.&nbsp; If there is a need for a corporate policy, **involve as many of the stakeholders as possible** into those decisions.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen several teams become disinterested and disheartened when a tool is forced upon them without their input or approval.

So instead of forcing the organization to use a certain build, bug tracking, or requirements gathering technology because of political or vendor-lock-in reasons, cultivate a set of values like &#8220;Simplicity&#8221;, &#8220;Feedback&#8221;, &#8220;Quality&#8221;, etc.&nbsp; **Values define principles and practices, practices reinforce values, and practices can be followed through tools.**&nbsp; By focusing on the values instead of tools, we can broaden our scope of practices to reinforce our values.&nbsp; Tools can enforce practices, but tools can **never** define values.&nbsp; If we focus on tools, our value system becomes warped and twisted towards the tool vendor&#8217;s values (selling their tool)&nbsp;or those pushing the tool internally (political, ego, or personal gain).
