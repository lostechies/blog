During a conversation at this week&#8217;s [ADNUG](http://adnug.org/), I realized the title of one of my latest posts ([Advanced mocking: auto-interaction testing](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2008/03/05/advanced-mocking-auto-interaction-testing.aspx)) had a misleading title.

I was trying to be clever with the Greek &#8220;auto&#8221; meaning &#8220;self&#8221;, so it was really about &#8220;**self-interaction testing**&#8220;, _not_ automatic-interaction testing, auto-mocking containers or anything like that.
