Check it out on the [Distributed Podcast](http://distributedpodcast.com/) site [here](http://distributedpodcast.com/2011/episode-6-interview-with-jimmy-bogard). We cover quite a wide variety of topics, from DTC, testing NServiceBus, migrating legacy systems and more.

Thanks to the two Jonathans, Andreas and Rinat for inviting me on, and to Daylight Savings Time to making it \*so\* much more difficult to coordinate recording a podcast with people in 4 cities and 3 continents.
