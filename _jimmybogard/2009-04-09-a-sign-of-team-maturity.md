You know you have a mature team when, nine months into a project, your testing stats are:

  * 2384 unit tests
  * 606 integration tests
  * 205 UI/acceptance tests

And _no one_ is asking to throw a party.&#160; In past teams, we would mark milestones, “500 tests, hooray!!”.&#160; With my current team, quality is not a goal, it’s a requirement for success.&#160; These stats tell us that we’re merely fulfilling expectations, of both our management and ourselves.&#160; A bar set high is a good thing.
