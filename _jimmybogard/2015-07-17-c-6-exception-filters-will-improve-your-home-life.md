If you&#8217;re like me and you enjoy nice, peaceful weekends, but keep getting hassled when something bad happens in production to shatter the blissful silence you&#8217;re enjoying, a great new feature of C# 6 will help you out:

Swallow exceptions &#8211; but only on weekends! Now you won&#8217;t get bothered any more, the app will always be up and running! The error logs will be nice and clean as if nothing has gone wrong at all.

This can be extended if it&#8217;s just one person hassling you a lot:

The possibilities are endless.
