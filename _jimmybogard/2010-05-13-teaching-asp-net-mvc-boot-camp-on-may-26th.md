A lot of what I try to do on this blog, user group presentations, and other community events is to try and share the knowledge and experience that I and my teammates have built up over the years.&#160; I’ve hosted talks on “How we do MVC” and things of that nature, blogged about our setup and so on.

However, it’s still tough to take away from these interactions something that a developer could take back to their team and immediately start writing maintainable ASP.NET MVC applications.&#160; Instead, a more immersive, hands-on instruction is needed.&#160; That’s why we created the [ASP.NET MVC Boot Camp](http://www.headspringsystems.com/services/agile-training/mvc-training/).

Out-of-the-box, ASP.NET MVC provides little to no guidance on how to successfully deliver MVC applications, which features to embrace, which to avoid and so on.&#160; In our 3-day course, I go through ASP.NET MVC from soup to nuts, walking through how we’ve used ASP.NET MVC to build clean, maintainable applications.&#160; At the end of the course, you’ll be able to go back to your team with the knowledge of how to build ASP.NET MVC 2 applications successfully.

The class runs 3 days from May 26th to May 28th (in 2 weeks), and there’s an available discount if you call Headspring at 512-459-2260.

So if you’re interested in how we do MVC and want to hit the ground running and skip all the trial and error that _we_ had to go through, call us to enroll.&#160; As part of the class, you also get 3 days to ask as many questions you like on how we use dependency injection, automated builds, source control, NHibernate, and anything else you’re curious about.&#160; Hope to see you there!
