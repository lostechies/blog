I love Gmail, and I really love its [labels](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6560), but I really really love its [filters](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6579).&nbsp; I had a hard time following all of the groups I wanted until [Joe](http://lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/default.aspx) showed me [how to drink from the firehose](http://lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2008/01/09/how-to-drink-from-a-fire-hose.aspx).&nbsp; Now I get greeted with a nice rainbow in Gmail:

With this, twitter, and Google Reader, sometime I feel like I need to quit my day job to keep up with the conversations.&nbsp; So now I have two problems: I&#8217;m running out of colors and running out of hours in the day.&nbsp; Anyone else have a worse rainbow than mine?
