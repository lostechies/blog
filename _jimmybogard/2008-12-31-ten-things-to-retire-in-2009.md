This year, 2008, was a year that saw many a new term or expression get ingrained in the minds of us .NET developers.&#160; Quite a few I’d rather not see in the next year, as they’ve overstayed their welcome.&#160; Some are catch-phrases, some are misapplied concepts, and others fall into the “make my brain hurt” category.&#160; Regardless of where they came from, here are ten .NET things I’d like to see make a graceful exit in the new year:

### 1) Open Spaces

I love me some open spaces, as I’ve had some great experiences with both the Austin ALT.NET Open Space and the recent KaizenConf open space.&#160; But somewhere along the way, a great idea got usurped, strangled, mangled and mass-produced into some kind of buzz-word hippie-fest where we sit around in circles and sing kum-by-ya.&#160; There’s a book on the subject, yet, just like Agile, a non-agenda for a conference became associated with Open Spaces.&#160; CowboyConf != Open Space.&#160; What comes after FooBar Conf?&#160; Wait, I know, it’s ScheißenConf.

### 2) Any MS ORM

First was the EF Vote of No Confidence, then the realization that EF was worse than we thought it was, then a little LINQ2SQL love, then a sad realization that L2S was going away.&#160; A popular, widely used, commercially supported ORM for .NET already exists.&#160; It just doesn’t come from the left coast.

### 3) Gloryhounds

Speaking of MS ORMs, has anyone else noticed the breeze blowing from all the hot air surrounding the new “experts” in the nascent technologies coming out of Redmond?&#160; If it’s not in Beta yet, you can’t be an expert unless you’re on the dev team.&#160; Being an expert in a product doesn’t mean you’re an expert in the field, that’s two entirely different purviews.&#160; Any time a new acronym rears its ugly head, you can bet there are several book deals, speaking engagements, articles and consulting gigs lined up to take advantage of a yet-to-be-proven technology.&#160; It would be amusing, if it didn’t drown out the useful conversations.

### 4) LINQ 2 Your mom

LINQ query expressions (not just the extension method operators) opened a whole new world of internal DSLs for .NET developers.&#160; Unfortunately, the compiler hooks to open up the “from…where…select” goodness were not made public, so the _really_ interesting boo-like applications were left in the dark.&#160; Instead, we get treated to weirdness like LINQ 2 Amazon and LINQ 2 WoW.&#160; What was that Jurassic Park line?&#160; “You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you didn&#8217;t stop to you if you should.”&#160; Unless you _really understand_ what the LINQ operators are doing under the covers, and what the underlying IQueryProvider object is doing underneath the covers, you’re just creating a hot mess.

### 5) FooDD

We have enough acronyms driving our design.&#160; DDD, TDD, BDD, SausageDD, let’s call the whole thing off.&#160; Unless you can define what these concepts/architectural styles describe, imply, infer in one volume, let’s just not talk about it.&#160;&#160; Underscores in a method name don’t count as a sea change, paradigm shift, quantum leap or revolution.&#160; The only caveat is if there is a Big Blue Book on the subject, which means it’s a game changer.&#160; Cherish that bible.

### 6) Feeding the trolls

Productive: (adj) Yielding favorable or useful results; constructive.&#160; There are certain folks in our community that, when provoked, will actually respond to your inanity.&#160; Do us all a favor, just shut up, and don’t provoke.

### 7) Fluent interfaces

Yes, you found the magical mystical extension method!&#160; It’s a miracle!&#160; Now put that hammer down, my face is not a nail.&#160; Just like #4 in this list, we’ve taken a useful idea in internal DSLs, and fouled it up just like you knew we would.&#160; You know what’s a great DSL?&#160; HTML.&#160; If I have to have two dozen characters, parentheses, angle brackets and percent signs to create “<form>” tag, something went awry.&#160; Clever is rarely simple, and unless that fluent baloney improves the situation, you’re a glorified code-sturbater.

### 8) The BCS

Nothing to do with coding, except that **computers** help decide who is in the NCAAF championship, where millions of dollars are at stake.&#160; One thing can be certain, Mizzou will never, ever vie for the title.&#160; Ever.

Nor Texas Tech.

Just thought I’d throw it out there, as I know someone reading this has the pull to make it happen.

### 9) Fear

It’s no coincidence that one of the XP values is Courage.&#160; Though we pride ourselves in pushing the envelope and branching out, why are we the quickest to bash a new concept?&#160; If you signed the EF VoNC without even looking at EF, you’re subtracting, not adding.&#160; Walk a bit in those other shoes before dismissing the framework, tool, concept or idea.&#160; Courage is trying something new despite all your inclinations not to.&#160; Think TFS is garbage?&#160; Try it out.&#160; Think SVN is for pinko FSF weirdos?&#160; Give it a week.&#160; Funny how the loudest protests come from those with the most ignorance.

### 10) Bold typeface in blog posts

One of my bigger pet peeves is **anything in bold**.&#160; It’s a cheap trick to grab attention, **yet it always works.**&#160; Yes, Atwood does it all the time and although **it grabs attention**, it’s the blogger equivalent of that dork that “quotes” “all” “his” “words”.&#160; The last thing we need is another **cookie-cutter Atwood knockoff.**

### 11) Top ten blog posters that can’t count

The worst offenders of all are those morons that create top-ten lists to grab attention and readers, yet can’t count.&#160; Oh wait…
