It was a good run.&nbsp; But it looks like your creators are giving you the axe, judging by the email I received today:

> We wanted to let you know we will be eliminating Profiles, the feature that allowed you to set up separate DVD Queues under one account, effective September 1, 2008.
> 
> Each additional Profile Queue will be unavailable after September 1, 2008. Before then, we recommend you consolidate any of your Profile Queues to your main account Queue or print them out.
> 
> While it may be disappointing to see Profiles go away, this change will help us continue to improve the Netflix website for all our customers.

My wife and I enjoyed you while it lasted, as it let us manage separate queues in one account.&nbsp; My wife had here movies, and I had my (better) movies.&nbsp; Although I&#8217;ll get fewer [Paltrow](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264150/) and [Hugh Grant](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130121/) movies, we&#8217;ll see a definite increase in [Stallone](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093692/) and [Bruce Willis](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/) movies.&nbsp; So, not a total loss.

I do appreciate the complete lack of any semblance of an explanation to your untimely demise.&nbsp; But, these unnamed improvements surely must be worth the sacrifice, right?

So adios Netflix profiles, we hardly knew ye.
