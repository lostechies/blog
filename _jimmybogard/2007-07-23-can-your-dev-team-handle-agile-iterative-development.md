Too often development teams or organizations push straight into an Agile/iterative process like [Scrum](http://www.controlchaos.com/) without considering the implications of iterative development.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iterative development forces regular feedback and regular deliveries, but how do we know if the dev team is able to handle feedback and deliver more often?&nbsp; If any of these criteria match your team,&nbsp;then&nbsp;you are&nbsp;going to have some major challenges adopting&nbsp;an Agile process:

  * Testability is&nbsp;not the&nbsp;top design concern 
      * Unit tests are optional or non-existent 
          * Builds happen less often&nbsp;than once a day 
              * Deployments to test environments happen even less often, if at all 
                  * &#8220;Quick and Dirty&#8221; is your team&#8217;s motto 
                      * Refactoring is considered taboo and dismissed as &#8220;over-engineering&#8221; 
                          * Email is the&nbsp;primary method of&nbsp;communication between team members 
                              * You don&#8217;t see the person giving you requirements for weeks or months at a time 
                                  * You don&#8217;t see the testers until&nbsp;just before releasing</ul> 
                                Feedback isn&#8217;t useful if your team or application can&#8217;t act on that feedback.&nbsp; Without solid engineering practices in place, adopting an iterative process will likely end in disaster, as the application wasn&#8217;t built to accept changes and feedback on a regular basis.
