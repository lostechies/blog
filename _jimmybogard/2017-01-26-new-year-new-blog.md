One of my resolutions this year was to take ownership of my digital content, and as such, I&#8217;ve launched a new blog at [jimmybogard.com](https://jimmybogard.com/). I&#8217;m keeping all my existing content on [Los Techies](https://jimmybogard.lostechies.com/), where I&#8217;ve been humbled to be a part of for the past [almost 10 years](http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/2007/11/joining-los-techies.html). Hundreds of posts, thousands of comments, and innumerable wrong opinions on software and systems, it&#8217;s been a great ride.

If you&#8217;re still subscribed to my FeedBurner feed &#8211; nothing to change, you&#8217;ll get everything as it should. If you&#8217;re only subscribed to the Los Techies feed&#8230;well you&#8217;ll need to [subscribe to my feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GrabBagOfT) now.

Big thanks to everyone at Los Techies that&#8217;s put up with me over the years, especially our site admin [Jason](https://jasonmeridth.com/), who has become far more knowledgable about WordPress than he ever probably wanted.
