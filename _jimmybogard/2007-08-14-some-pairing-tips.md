One of the stranger things I noticed about [pair programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html) was that I felt I was&nbsp;more efficient working with a pair than working on task alone.&nbsp; Mostly I felt it was because not only did I have someone to help out when I got slowed down, but interruptions had a bigger impact as there was someone sitting next to me, waiting for the interruption to &#8220;go away&#8221;.

I know it&#8217;s a shocker, but interruptions can have a huge impact on productivity, as [we can&#8217;t multitask](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070327-study-says-leave-the-multitasking-to-your-computer.html), and [too much email slows us down and stresses us out](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070814-e-mail-stress-slowing-down-workers-say-researchers.html).&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to&nbsp;some basic [pairing etiquette rules](http://www.lukemelia.com/devblog/archives/2006/10/10/on-pairing-etiquette/),&nbsp;here are&nbsp;some general pairing tips to help improve your pairing productivity:

  * Close email (both webmail&nbsp;AND&nbsp;Outlook) 
      * Close any RSS readers/aggregators 
          * Close any browser windows irrelevant to current task (i.e., that eBay item you&#8217;re sniping) 
              * Set any IM clients to &#8220;Away&#8221; or with a message of &#8220;Pairing&#8221; 
                  * Set your phone to &#8220;vibrate&#8221;</ul> 
                By forcing ourselves to minimize distractions, we also had to set aside parts of the day to deal with the distractions.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t that we ignored emails and such, it&#8217;s that we would only allow ourselves to address those distractions outside of pairing sessions.&nbsp; This lets us get closer to the 5-6 [ideal engineering hours](http://www.possibility.com/epowiki/Wiki.jsp?page=IdealEngineeringDay) per day that we used for capacity calculations.
