An interesting quote from a colleague today (paraphrased):

> Moving developers to projects on the legacy system is like rearranging chairs on the Titanic.

We can tidy it up, but it&#8217;s still going to the bottom of the Atlantic.&nbsp; Probably better just to catch the plane.

It came up in the context of [investing strategically versus buying tactically](http://agilemanager.blogspot.com/2007/09/investing-in-strategic-capability.html).&nbsp; It&#8217;s not an either-or question, but it&#8217;s important to be thinking about long-term goals and assigning resources appropriately to match your strategic view.&nbsp; The [Technical Debt metaphor](http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/2007/07/when-technical-debt-leads-to-bankruptcy.html)&nbsp;can offer guidance here&nbsp;too, as buying tactically tends to max out your credit cards (so to speak), while investing strategically actually nets returns.
