The annual [Austin Code Camp](http://codecamp13.adnug.org/), scheduled for August 17th, is now open for registration. The Austin Code Camp is 100% free and run completely by volunteers, with support from the [Austin .NET Users Group](http://adnug.org/) (ADNUG).

The call for speakers is also open, and we’re welcoming pretty much any topic that is remotely .NET related. We’re also looking for sponsors and volunteers, so check out the website for more information:

Hope to see you there!
