A few months ago, [Jeffrey Palermo](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/default.aspx) approached me at an AgileATX meeting to join him at [Headspring Systems](http://www.headspringsystems.com/index.jsp).&nbsp; After much cajoling and intimidation (Jeff&#8217;s a big guy), I accepted the offer, and today I started my new job.&nbsp; Headspring Systems offered me a great opportunity to help customers succeed, where success might not mean just developing whatever requirement the customer throws at me.

Headspring is a .NET shop that uses ALT.NET/Agile principles to deliver solutions.&nbsp; That means this blog is going to start seeing a lot more NHibernate, StructureMap, Domain-Driven Design, Behavior-Driven Design, design patterns, ASP.NET MVC, and a whole lot less on legacy code.&nbsp; I love the Michael Feathers, but legacy code is a challenge I like to tackle where there is a commitment to pay down the technical debt.&nbsp; We&#8217;re also committed not create _more_ legacy code, which is also a refreshing philosophy.

Also, it&#8217;s my first consulting experience, so any advice is welcome ðŸ™‚ (e.g. customer is always wrong, etc.).
