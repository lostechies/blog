[Cross posted](http://automapper.org/blog/2011/09/12/automapper-completely-moved-to-github/) from the [AutoMapper blog](http://automapper.org/blog) (which I hope to stop cross-posting, eventually): 

> AutoMapper is now completely moved to GitHub: 
> 
> [AutoMapper GitHub](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper) 
> 
> I’ve updated the site on CodePlex to reflect this move, and moved all existing content over: 
> 
>   * All issues have been moved to the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/issues) 
>       * All wiki pages have been moved to the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki). 
>           * All downloads have been replicated on the [GitHub downloads page](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/downloads)</ul> 
>         Having all of the project-level information in one spot will make it easier to manage. I’m not going to delete the CodePlex site, but I will not monitor that site going forward.</blockquote> 
>         
>         For more AutoMapper updates, subscribe to the [AutoMapper blog feed](https://feeds.feedburner.com/AutoMapperBlog). In creating the AutoMapper GitHub site, I created the [AutoMapper organization](https://github.com/AutoMapper) to host both the website code and AutoMapper source code.

>         In other news, getting close to a 2.0 beta, just making the Silverlight 4 tests pass.
