I&#8217;m getting pretty tired of cross-posting, so I&#8217;m making the permanent move over to [Los Techies](http://lostechies.com).&nbsp; After all, if I get a free t-shirt:

Then the least I can do is stop dipping my toe in the pool and just jump in.&nbsp; Cross-posting is for chumps anyway.

You don&#8217;t need to update your feeds, except the feed now links to Los Techies.&nbsp; This will be my last post on the blogspot site (sniff, sniff), and while you treated me well blogspot, your name doesn&#8217;t rhyme with a tasty, tasty beer.
