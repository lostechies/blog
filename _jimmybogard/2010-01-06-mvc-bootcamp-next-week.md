Next week, I’ll be teaching a 3-day course on ASP.NET MVC, as part of [Headspring’s](http://www.headspring.com)&#160;[ASP.NET MVC Boot Camp](http://www.headspringsystems.com/services/agile-training/mvc-training/).&#160; The material touches on a lot of the ASP.NET MVC features we use day-to-day, as well as looking at how _we_ use ASP.NET MVC.&#160; Topics will include (but not be limited to):

  * History/Overview of ASP.NET MVC 
  * Separated solution structure 
  * Basic & customized routes 
  * Customized route handlers 
  * Controller selection 
  * customized controller factories 
  * Controller & Action patterns & anti-patterns 
  * Read-only views 
  * Data-entry views 
  * Presentation Model 
  * Advanced ActionResults 
  * Action filters and ActionFilterAttribute 
  * Server-side validation 
  * JQuery integration 
  * Deployment and installation 
  * Advanced View Helpers 
  * AJAX with ASP.NET MVC 
  * T4 Templating 
  * Connecting with data access, messaging, etc. 

We’ve really put MVC through its paces over the past couple of years, so I’m excited about sharing what we’ve learned (at least everything I can fit in 3 days).&#160; You can call us to enroll: (877) 459-2260.&#160; Hope to see you there!
