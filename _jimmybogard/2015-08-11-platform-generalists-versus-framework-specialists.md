A trend I&#8217;ve noticed especially in Javascript/front-end jobs are emphasizing, requiring, even titling jobs after specific Javascript frameworks. &#8220;Ember.js engineer needed&#8221;. &#8220;Angular programmer&#8221;. This raises a few of thoughts for me:

  * Is the framework so complicated you need someone with extensive experience building non-trivial apps?
  * Is your timeline so short you don&#8217;t have time to teach anyone a framework?

Earlier in my career, when WPF was announced, I had a choice to invest time in my career to learning it. It was the obvious successor to WinForms, and \*the\* way to build thick-client apps in .NET, if not Windows going forward. I hesitated, and decided against it, after learning more about the technology and seeing how proprietary it was.

Instead, I doubled-down on the web, learning server-side frameworks to help build web apps more than ever. ASP.NET MVC embraced the web, unlike WebForms, which had its own invented abstractions. All the WebForms knowledge I had is more or less wasted for me, and I vowed to never again become so engrossed with a technology that I become specialist in a framework at the expense of understanding the platform it&#8217;s built upon.

I don&#8217;t want to be an &#8220;Ember&#8221; guy, an &#8220;Angular&#8221; dev, an &#8220;Aurelia&#8221; expert. I want to be a web expert, a messaging expert, a REST expert, a distributed systems expert. I saw this most clearly recently when helping out on a Spring MVC project. Because I understood web platforms, I could pick up the framework easily. The parts in Spring that were hard were hard because of the complexity of the framework, and those were parts I was a lot less inclined to be an expert upon.

One of the biggest reasons I&#8217;ve shied away from new, all-inclusive, heavyweight frameworks is it&#8217;s a tradeoff for me of potential productivity and administrivia knowledge. I&#8217;ve only got so much room in my head, and I&#8217;d much rather it be occupied with more important things, like vintage Seinfeld/Simpsons quotes.
