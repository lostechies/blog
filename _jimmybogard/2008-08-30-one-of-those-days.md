I had one of those days the other day.&nbsp; Not quite a case of the Mondays, but one where I thought maybe I should just go home and start over.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re trying to get this test to pass:

<pre>[<span style="color: #2b91af">Test</span>]
<span style="color: blue">public void </span>Good_times()
{
    <span style="color: #2b91af">Regex</span>.IsMatch(<span style="color: #a31515">@"^d*$"</span>, <span style="color: #a31515">"123456"</span>).ShouldBeTrue();
}
</pre>

Then maybe it&#8217;s time to call it a day.&nbsp; You really don&#8217;t want to know how many regex tutorial and expression evaluator sites I went to on this one.&nbsp; Only to find out my method arguments were backwards.
