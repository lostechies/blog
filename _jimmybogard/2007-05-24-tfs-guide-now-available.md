One thing I always thought was missing from MSDN regarding TFS was any kind of guidance or best practices.&nbsp; Just released was a Beta 1 of a TFS Best Practices guide, and after taking a quick look at the contents (over 300 pages) it has&nbsp;a _ton_ of great information.&nbsp; The section on Team Build is worth its weight in gold, as it not only covers good build practices, but relates them to Team Build.

[Latest Release](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSGuide/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=4442)

This document was put out by the [Microsoft Patterns and Practices](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/default.aspx) team, and while the document is a Beta, and it&#8217;s easy to go straight to the guidance you need.&nbsp; It even has a whole chapter dedicated to [Continuous Integration](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html), though it does have the caveat&nbsp;&#8220;Team Foundation Server 2005 does not provide a CI solution out of box&#8221;.&nbsp; TFS does provide the framework to support it, so you have tools like [TeamCI](http://teamsystemrocks.com/files/12/tools/entry1018.aspx), [TFS Integrator](http://notgartner.wordpress.com/2006/09/18/getting-started-with-tfs-integrator/), and [Automaton](http://www.codeplex.com/automation).&nbsp; Also&nbsp;nice&nbsp;is&nbsp;a chapter on Large Project Considerations, and many other chapters have sections dedicated to large project considerations.

The book is laid out into separate parts:

  * Fundamentals 
      * Source Control 
          * Builds 
              * Large Project Consideration 
                  * Project Management 
                      * Process Templates 
                          * Reporting 
                              * Setting Up and Maintaining</ul> 
                            It finishes out with a list of:
                            
                              * Guidelines 
                                  * Practices 
                                      * Questions and Answers 
                                          * How Tos</ul> 
                                        All in all, a pretty nice reference, and something I really wish I had a year ago.
