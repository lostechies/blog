In three easy steps:

  1. Separate those making decisions from those affected by the&nbsp;decisions
  2. Remove accountability from the decision makers for the decisions made
  3. Rinse, repeat

After&nbsp;going to the inaugural&nbsp;[Agile Austin](http://www.agileaustin.org/) group meeting [last night](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/09/05/agileaustin-kick-off-meeting-a-big-success.aspx), I&#8217;m convinced more than ever that a siloed&nbsp;organizational structure&nbsp;forces the steps listed above.
