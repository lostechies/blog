I&#8217;ve had quite a few job titles where I basically did the same function: Software Engineer, Software Developer, Technical Lead, and so on.&nbsp; In some companies, a Software Developer is a completely different position than Software Engineer, and in others they&#8217;re used interchangeably.

The connotations and implications from each title are strikingly different.&nbsp; The term &#8220;engineer&#8221; has a much different meaning than &#8220;developer&#8221;, taken outside the context of software. A Developer might lay out the plan of a new subdivision, where its green areas are, what style homes should be built and what theme the neighborhood should adhere to.&nbsp; The Engineer lays out the water and sewage lines, elevations, roads, utilities and other functions vital for sustainable human habitability.&nbsp; **A Developer creates the vision and designs the implementation, while the Engineer ensures that quality, regulatory and ethical standards have been met**.

That&#8217;s not to say an Engineer isn&#8217;t creative.&nbsp; In a family full of Engineering graduates (including myself), no Engineer would have a job if they weren&#8217;t creative.&nbsp; Every problem is an implementation of a different pattern, but the details make each challenge completely different than the one before.

Having worked with many types of real Engineers (i.e., they&#8217;re doing the job they went to school for), I didn&#8217;t see what they were doing was much different than me.&nbsp; They were concerned with:

  * Safety
  * Reliability
  * Maintainability
  * Aesthetics
  * Usability

As well as a host of other &#8220;ilities&#8221;.&nbsp; One critical difference between me as a Developer and they as an Engineer was that **Engineers are licensed by an [independent group](http://www.ncees.org/).**

In many fields and jurisdiction, including Civil Engineering in Texas, **licensing is required by law when performing engineering services for the public**.&nbsp; Licensing isn&#8217;t easy, either.&nbsp; To become a licensed Professional Engineer PE, you must:

  * Graduate from an accredited engineering program
  * Take an initial exam to become an Engineering-in-Training (EIT)
  * Have a minimum of 4 years experience as an EIT, preferably as an apprentice to another PE
  * Take a rigorous exam, which takes 6-8 hours to complete

Licensing isn&#8217;t a one-time affair, you have to renew your license, which has its own requirements including continuing education.&nbsp; Even if not working in the public sector, licensing is considered a career necessity.

### But we have certifications, right?

Anyone that has interviewed candidates for positions knows the sad state of software certifications.&nbsp; **At best, software certifications signify that your are certified to be an absolute beginner for that topic.**&nbsp; For some reason, software certifications still hold value, though all involved, managers, HR and candidates, know that the certifications aren&#8217;t worth bytes it was emailed with.

Would licensing help our industry?&nbsp; We live in a sad state of affairs when identities are not stolen because of sifting through your mail or stealing your wallet, but [because of careless, ignorant developers](http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Oklahoma-Leaks-Tens-of-Thousands-of-Social-Security-Numbers,-Other-Sensitive-Data.aspx).&nbsp; In a Twitter conversation with an [ex-colleague](http://terrbear.org/), Terry noted that software development lacked discipline, respect and accountability.&nbsp; Can licensing help prevent the ridiculous failures, by both raising the bar and raising the stakes for individual failure?

If a bridge fails, the engineers can be held liable if they are found to cut corners, or even sheer ignorance.&nbsp; Oversight in the form of inspectors is supposed to help, but in the end, the engineers are held accountable.

I see Developers as code monkeys, slapping code out without regard to reliability and maintainability.&nbsp; Engineers have a much longer horizon too look at, they must ensure the bridge they build lasts 100 years, not six months.&nbsp; **Shouldn&#8217;t we hold ourselves up to the same standard?**
