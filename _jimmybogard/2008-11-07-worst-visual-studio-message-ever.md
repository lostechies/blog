This is about the worst Visual Studio message, ever:

This happens to me about once every two weeks, when I do an SVN Update from Tortoise.&#160; I forget to Save All, and my Project changes weren’t saved.&#160; Instead, SVN overwrote my changes, and no matter what, it’s a long road to get back to sanity. 

So, if you want to stay sane, Ctrl+Shift+S before doing an Update.
