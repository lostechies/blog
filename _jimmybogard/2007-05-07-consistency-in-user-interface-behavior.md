I know I can&#8217;t be the only person that gets annoyed by this, but the developers of Windows Messenger and Office Communicator must have been on crack when they determined behavior for the &#8220;Close&#8221; and &#8220;Minimize&#8221; button.&nbsp; Every application I have ever used closes when I hit &#8220;X&#8221; and minimizes when I hit &#8220;\_&#8221; in the title bar.&nbsp; Tray icon applications are even smart enough to minimize to the tray when I hit &#8220;\_&#8221;.&nbsp; But they still close when I hit &#8220;X&#8221;.

For some reason MS wants to be above this.&nbsp; When you hit &#8220;X&#8221;, it doesn&#8217;t close Communicator.&nbsp; No, you didn&#8217;t REALLY mean to close (exit)&nbsp;it, you just wanted to minimize it to the tray icon.&nbsp; For some funny reason, 99.9% of all tray icon applications actually CLOSE and EXIT when I hit &#8220;X&#8221;.&nbsp; Even other MS tray icon applications follow this rule.&nbsp; I use Virtual PC 2007, and when I hit &#8220;X&#8221;, it exits the whole application.&nbsp; When I hit &#8220;\_&#8221;, it minimizes to the tray.&nbsp; But now I have to think twice when I have VPC 2007 open.&nbsp; I have to wonder, is this one of those MS applications where close means minimize?&nbsp; Oops, I clicked &#8220;X&#8221;, and that was really &#8220;Close&#8221; for this one.&nbsp; Time to start over.&nbsp; So now with MS tray icon applications I always click &#8220;\_&#8221; first to try and minimize to tray, and if that doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;ll click &#8220;X&#8221; next.&nbsp; Forever a two-step process, thanks a bunch.&nbsp; Real intuitive.

Lack of consistency in the behavior of common tasks such as clicking the &#8220;X&#8221; button just kill me.&nbsp; You may want a New and Improved Way of doing things, but if you violate the consistency and expected behavior of an operation, you&#8217;ll likely infuriate your end users no matter how great the new behavior may be.
