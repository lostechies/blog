Iâ€™ve (finally) officially launched the official AutoMapper site at [AutoMapper.org](http://automapper.org/). It will be a central location for links to AutoMapper resources (mailing list, source, wiki, blog etc.) as well as a spot for [news and announcements](http://automapper.org/blog). I also have an [AutoMapper Blog RSS feed](https://feeds.feedburner.com/AutoMapperBlog) for the seven people that want to keep up-to-date with the latest AutoMapper news.

The site represents the absolute limit of my design abilities, so I probably should have [followed Hanselmanâ€™s advice](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HireAndPayADesignerAndBeHappy.aspx) and hired a designer (oh well).

Check out the [announcement](http://automapper.org/blog/2011/08/22/automapper-site-launched/) below:

> Itâ€™s about time, I know, but Iâ€™ve finally launched the AutoMapper website at [AutoMapper.org](http://automapper.org/). Itâ€™s a single place to consolidate all things AutoMapper, where youâ€™ll find links to source, the wiki, the latest drop, the mailing list, and a blog. 
> 
> I plan to use the blog as a way to publish AutoMapper news and announcements, whereas the wiki will be a spot for sample code etc. You can [subscribe to the AutoMapper blog](https://feeds.feedburner.com/AutoMapperBlog) to get updates and announcements. This will include things like roadmaps, release notes and so on. 
> 
> This site was built using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [Toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto), hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) with DNS provided by [dnsimple](https://dnsimple.com/). The source is also [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.website) in case anyone wants to laugh at my amateur Ruby code. 
> 
> Coming soon â€“ an exciting (yet late) announcement on a Beta of AutoMapper 2.0!

Probably the coolest part about developing this site is that the only thing I had to pay for amongst all these components was the domain name â€“ also made uber-easy with dnsimple. Dnsimple provides insanely easy integration with Heroku, to where I just needed to click a button to add Heroku support. 

Iâ€™ll blog soon about how I got the site set up, as well as the components I used to build it. Did I already mention the site is hosted for free? ðŸ˜‰

Feedback is welcome and encouraged, preferably in the form of pull requests!
