I just ordered [Kent Beck&#8217;s](http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/) newest book, [Implementation Patterns](http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321413091).&nbsp; In the [sample chapter online](http://www.informit.com/content/images/9780321413093/samplechapter/BeckCh_0321413091.pdf), there&#8217;s a great quote at the end of the preface:

> As a programmer you have been given time, talent, money, and opportunity. What will you do to make responsible use of these gifts?

That pretty much sums up why I started caring about the code I delivered when I started my career.&nbsp; After seeing someone else&#8217;s insane legacy codebase for the first time, I felt a need to learn to code responsibly.&nbsp; Coding irresponsibly wastes time and money, and life&#8217;s too short to waste on sloppy code.

By the way, if you register with [informIT](http://www.informit.com/), you get a 30% member discount that usually brings the price lower than Amazon.
