There&#8217;s been more and more buzz on [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/), especially in the Agile community.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re interested in seeing what this dynamically-typed language is all about, try out the following 15 minute interactive tutorial on Ruby:

I&#8217;m interested in learning more about Rails.&nbsp; Something always seemed off to me with ASP.NET, where easy scenarios with classic ASP became much more difficult in ASP.NET.&nbsp; Working with DataGrids and GridViews is always a nightmare.&nbsp; All of the ViewState, page event lifecycle, postbacks, controls, etc.&nbsp;seemed to abstract the easy stuff (HTML) and mostly just get in the way of what I want to do.
