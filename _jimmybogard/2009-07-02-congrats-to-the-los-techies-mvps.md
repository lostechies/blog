This morning, I and fellow Los Techies alumni Eric Hexter and Chris Patterson learned that we are MVPs!&#160; Well, technically I learned last night through an IM of a re-tweet of my MVP lead, but hey, close enough, right?&#160; I know it’s cheesy, but I think these awards are a testament to the great community Los Techies has built over the years, so for me, this is really an award for Los Techies.&#160; The roundup includes:

  * Jimmy Bogard, MVP ASP.NET
  * Eric Hexter, MVP ASP.NET
  * Chris Patterson, MVP C#

Personally, I’ve viewed my community involvement as simply a desire to share my journey with others, and in turn learn where others have been and are going.&#160; My favorite experiences thus far have been the open space conferences, book clubs, dojos and code camps, as it gives me a great chance to meet and talk with a lot of smart people.&#160; Thanks again everyone!
