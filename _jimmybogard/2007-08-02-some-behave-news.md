Joe [already announced this](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/07/27/good-bye-nunit-behave-hello-behave.aspx), but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to get the word out some more, right?&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to combine our efforts into [Behave#](http://www.codeplex.com/BehaveSharp), a [behavior-driven design](http://behaviour-driven.org/) framework.&nbsp; For more information about our framework, check out Joe&#8217;s posts [here](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/06/28/introducing-nunit-behave-or-insert-what-ever-other-catchy-name.aspx) and [here](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/07/15/more-bdd-xbehave-madness.aspx), as well as my [announcement](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2007/07/11/introducing-behave.aspx).

I had already released a pre-alpha version of Behave# before Joe and I decided to combine our projects, but we&#8217;ll soon be formalizing our efforts with a vision statement.&nbsp; We may not have [angels singing](http://elegantcode.com/?p=621)&nbsp;yet, but I hope to get there soon.&nbsp; If you already have some features in mind that you&#8217;d like us to address, we&#8217;ll be using the issue tracker in CodePlex for determining feature priority (though our votes override all others ðŸ™‚ ).&nbsp; I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing how this all turns out.&nbsp; Stay tuned!
