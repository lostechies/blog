The best AutoMapper feature request I’ve received so far is one I got at the recent ALT.NET conference:

“Can you please not call the release ‘Alpha’?”

Well, that’s easy.

It’s funny how much the name of a release can influence perception of the quality of that product.&#160; I’ve called the latest releases “Alpha” for no particular reason, other than it was the first selection in CodePlex’s select list for labeling releases.&#160; We’ve used AutoMapper for around 6 months in a production application, so it’s not like AutoMapper hasn’t seen its first rodeo.&#160; But because of the Alpha moniker, some viewed it as unstable or not ready for production.&#160; On my side, I might has well called it AutoMapper 2009 Deluxe Platinum edition.

But looking back to other libraries I’ve looked at, I’ve had the same opinion:

  * Stayed away from Castle because it was stuck at RC for a looooong time
  * Stayed away from Spring because it didn’t have a release for a year
  * Stayed away from NHibernate because it wasn’t 1.0

You get the idea.&#160; Back when I was on a product team, I remember having “version wars” with a competitor.&#160; Here’s the timeline:

  * We release version 2.0
  * Competitor releases version 4.0, skipping 3.0 altogether
  * Marketing wants to rebrand ours as 3.0
  * Devs just want to follow normal assembly versioning conventions, pretty please?

We wound up going with yearly release titles, like Visual Studio 2008.&#160; Like Visual Studio, we had a couple of close shaves, almost releasing our product in the year after its name proclaimed.&#160; Because our brochures were already printed, that was an interesting couple of months at the end of the year.&#160; But playing version wars with a competitor (just like chasing features) isn’t really a game we wanted to play.

Years in version numbers have their own issues, as the software seems out of date when the year passes by.&#160; Who wants to buy a product named for two years ago?

Just to be safe, the next AutoMapper version will be the version 5.0 Solid Gold Diamond Deluxe Signature Elite Oompa-Loompa Edition.
