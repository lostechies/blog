Yesterday the [C4MVC](http://www.c4mvc.net/) guys hosted a screencast with me on UI testing ASP.NET MVC.&#160; It was a lot of fun, but I actually forgot I was being videotaped (webcam’d?), so all those times I turned off my mic to catch a drink of water or cough uncontrollably are caught in glorious 370i.&#160; Anyway, check out the video here:

<div style="padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent">
  <div>
  </div>
</div>

Unfortunately, I didn’t leave enough time for questions at the end, and I had some good ones from the audience.&#160; You can also find the [complete code and slides here](http://grabbagoftimg.s3.amazonaws.com/uitesting-trunk.zip).

Thanks again to the C4MVC guys for hosting me!&#160; Since I didn’t have time to answer too many questions, feel free to ask them in the comments, or you can always use the Contact Me link.
