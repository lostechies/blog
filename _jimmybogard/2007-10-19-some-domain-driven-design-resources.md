[Eric Evans&#8217; book](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/) may be the definitive resource, but there&#8217;s quite a lot of supporting information on print and on the web.&nbsp; For those looking to start looking at what all the DDD buzz is about, or just wanted to catch the next acronym wave, here&#8217;s a list of resources for domain-driven design:

                                Personally, I&#8217;d start with the InfoQ article, then flush out that with the rest of the books.&nbsp; For most other questions, the Yahoo group is a great resource as are plain old&nbsp;Google searches.
