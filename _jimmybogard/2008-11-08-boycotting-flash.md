I’ve had it.&#160; I’m done with Flash and Silverlight and any other bogus “Rich Internet Application” technology used to deliver what should be normal websites on the WWW.&#160; Now, internal websites/applications are something entirely different.

But relying on Flash to deliver information guarantees an absolutely abysmal user experience.&#160; Designers, I know you’re a clever artsy bunch, but most of the time these types of sites leave users guessing on what to do and where to click.&#160; Websites aren’t meant to be a guessing game.&#160; But in Flash sites, I’m relegated to wave the mouse around to see what I’m supposed to click.&#160; It’s a fun game, maybe there are some Easter eggs hidden in there.&#160; Is that little box the Menu page?&#160; Oh yes, because the box unfolded and a flower popped out.

I remember the days when Flash sites had a “low bandwidth” option.&#160; For me it was the “you just want to get to the information and not see a dancing clown” option.&#160; I can’t copy text.&#160; I can’t bookmark pages.&#160; Back/forward doesn’t work.&#160; I enter a new land, where the last 10 years of using the HTML paradigm do not work, and it’s now up to the whim of the designer to invent a new paradigm, hopefully incorporating some lame Smash Mouth song.

Please, designers, leave Flash to where it belongs – ads, games and streamed content.&#160; If you’re a restaurant, I don’t care about entering your site through a Flash facade of your physical location.&#160; I don’t want to click a door to enter.&#160; I just want to see the menu.&#160; I just want to place a to-go order.&#160; I just want to find your closest location.&#160; Not solve some Myst-type labyrinth of insanity.&#160; My favorite Firefox plugin – [Flashblock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433) – lets me boycott Flash.&#160; I’ll decide when I want that garbage to show up, thank you very much.
