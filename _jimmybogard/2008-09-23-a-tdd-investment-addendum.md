I completely left out one very important tip in my [top 10 tips to get a return on your TDD investment](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2008/09/21/ten-tips-to-maximize-the-return-on-your-tdd-investment.aspx):

**Take advantage of pair-programming**.

Pair programming is a great teaching device, as it lets two people go back and forth, working on a problem.&nbsp; By pairing someone new to TDD with someone experienced, the knowledge transfer happens much faster.&nbsp; Not only that, but questions get answered immediately, and barriers get knocked down faster with two eyes on the code.

I don&#8217;t pair _all_ the time in day-to-day work, but I try to recognize difficult or design-heavy work, which is the real sweet spot for pair programming.&nbsp; Pairing on visual design, HTML or CSS is an absolute bore for everyone involved.

But especially with learning TDD, pair programming is the grease that keeps the machine running.&nbsp; As with any new skill, beginners will get tripped up quite a bit at first.&nbsp; With the real-time code review of pair programming, the more experienced developer can guide and assist a beginner, ensuring they don&#8217;t fall completely flat on their face.
