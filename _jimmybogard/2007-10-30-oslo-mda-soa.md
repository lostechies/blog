Yeah, yeah, too many acronyms.&nbsp; One of the biggest challenges in large enterprises is getting all of the disparate systems and applications to talk to each other in a well-defined, agreed-upon&nbsp;manner.&nbsp; Announced [here](http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci1280299,00.html) and blogged [here](http://samgentile.com/blogs/samgentile/archive/2007/10/30/microsoft-soa-and-bpm-conference-oslo.aspx), it looks like Microsoft is hoping to fill some of the gaps other big players in the SOA world (like IBM) have already filled.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a quote describing Oslo&nbsp;from Microsoft:

> Rather than having models being imported and exported and generating code, the model is the application and that breaks down the silos.

Oslo looks to bring [model-driven architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture)&nbsp;and SOA&nbsp;together with WCF, BizTalk, Visual Studio&nbsp;and other Microsoft tools and technologies to provide a single Microsoft solution for connected and distributed systems.&nbsp; For me this is good news because the other big players like IBM and Oracle are mostly or exclusively Java, so it will be nice to have an answer from the .NET side.
