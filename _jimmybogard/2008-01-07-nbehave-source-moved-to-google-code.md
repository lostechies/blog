Well, we&#8217;re fed up with it.&nbsp; [CodePlex](http://codeplex.com/) is&nbsp;a great home for everything&#8230;except source control.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve decided to keep all things project related (wiki, releases, discussions, etc.) on CodePlex, but move our source to [Google Code](http://code.google.com/).

We got the inspiration from the MvcContrib project, which is doing the same thing.&nbsp; Too many people love their SVN, it turns out.&nbsp; With Google Code, we can use SVN as our SCC provider instead of TFS.&nbsp; Pulling down source, submitting patches, and other source-related tasks should get much easier.

Our Google Code project can be found here:

[http://nbehave.googlecode.com](http://nbehave.googlecode.com "http://nbehave.googlecode.com")

And the source can be browsed here:

[http://nbehave.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/](http://nbehave.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ "http://nbehave.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/")

Our public CCNET instance has been updated, which can be found here:

[http://ccnet.nbehave.org/](http://ccnet.nbehave.org/ "http://ccnet.nbehave.org/")

It&#8217;s been a bit of a journey integration NSpec and finding a new home for the source code, and moving to SVN should make all of our lives a little easier.
