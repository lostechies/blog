My co-worker [Tim](http://timgthomas.com) is writing about a recent project where he headed up a team building a mobile application as an HTML5 application. It’s a fascinating problem, especially with news of Facebook ditching their HTML5 app in favor of a native strategy.

HTML5 vs. Native is one of those decisions that there really never is one universal answer on what the right way to go is. For our client, a non-native app was the right way to go, but for others (like Facebook), there were native features and usability that you really _needed_ a native experience.

It was a challenging experience, where we had to try many different avenues (like Azure vs. AppHarbor), and Tim’s writing a whole series about it. Check it out!
