Last week, Jeffrey, Ben and I were interviewed by Jon Arild Tørresdal at InfoQ to talk about our recent book [ASP.NET MVC in Action](http://manning.com/palermo/).&#160; I’ve always loved the InfoQ interviews (as well as their articles), as they asked us really great questions.&#160; Not the normal “do you like ASP.NET MVC or do you <u>like like</u> ASP.NET MVC”?&#160; You can check out the [interview here](http://www.infoq.com/articles/aspnet-mvc-in-action).

In addition to the interview, we also put up a free chapter and a discount code for 35% off the book.&#160; Thanks again to the InfoQ team for the interview, and as always, a great website with great content!
