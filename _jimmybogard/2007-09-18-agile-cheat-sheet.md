I already have the [ReSharper cheat sheet](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/documentation/ReSharper30DefaultKeymap.pdf)&nbsp;and a&nbsp;[Smells to Refactorings quick reference](https://lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2007/09/10/smells-to-refactorings-quick-reference.aspx).&nbsp; For those who have every cheat sheet taped to their walls,&nbsp;[Dave Laribee](http://laribee.com/blog/)&nbsp;created a nice Agile cheat sheet, that includes both the manifesto and the principles:

Too often introductions and conversations about Agile jump straight to specific processes and tools, so it&#8217;s nice to have a nice little reminder of our team&#8217;s goals visible to whoever walks by.&nbsp; It also serves as a good introduction to anyone that stops by that&#8217;s not familiar what Agile is all about, or has only heard of it through processes like Scrum or XP.&nbsp; I just love the visible information these cheat sheets provide&#8230;
