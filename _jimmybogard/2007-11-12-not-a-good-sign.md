At the end of lunch today at a Chinese restaurant, I cracked open the obligatory fortune cookie to learn what a stale, shrink-wrapped, mass-produced dessert could portend.

It was empty.

I ask for&nbsp;insight into my fate, and the&nbsp;gods answer in their infinite wisdom,&nbsp;&#8220;[Mu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative))&#8220;.

Coming after a big launch at work, I really didn&#8217;t know what to think about this one.&nbsp; Can&#8217;t I just get one cookie tell me &#8220;Your launch will be great success.&nbsp; And the Rockets will win&nbsp;tonight.&#8221;&nbsp; Is that really too much to ask?
