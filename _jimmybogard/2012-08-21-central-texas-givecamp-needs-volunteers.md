Next month, a few of us at Headspring are putting on the [Central Texas GiveCamp](http://ctxgivecamp.org/). For the uninitiated, a [GiveCamp](http://givecamp.org/) is a weekend-long event where us as developers/coders/designers get together to put our skills to good use for non-profit organizations. It’s a fun weekend where we code for charity, building solutions that non-profits don’t have the time/budget/ability to build themselves.

We’ve got a good number of charities lined up that we’re excited to help, but what we need YOUR help on is to volunteer! Whether you’re a designer, DB admin, designer, or just an all-around nice person, head over to our [EventBrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3870490742?ref=ebtn) page to register.

We’re also still looking for sponsors to help feed the developers, because although we’ll code for free, we still need basic sustenance to make it through the weekend.

Hope to see you there!
