Flash has crashed for the (hopefully) last time. I’m going to run a little experiment. **I’m uninstalling Flash** and see how much it affects browsing experience for say, one month.

I suspect that most experiences will be fine on Chrome, except for poorly designed websites who force you to browse information through Flash. For legitimate uses of Flash, like video streaming, I don’t really know who does or does not support Flash yet.

I’ll report back in a month with the results. Or less if you really can’t use the web without Flash anymore.
