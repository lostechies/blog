[AutoMapper 3.3 Release Notes](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/releases/tag/v3.3.0)

And download it from NuGet. Some highlights in the release include:

  * Open generic support
  * Explicit LINQ expansion
  * Custom constructors for LINQ projection
  * Custom type converter support for LINQ projection
  * Parameterized LINQ queries
  * Configurable member visibility
  * Word/character replacement in member matching

In this release, I added documentation for every new feature (linked in the release notes), and pertinent improvements.

This will likely be the last 3.x release, as for the next release Iâ€™ll be focusing on refactoring for custom convention support, plus supporting the new .NET core runtime (and therefore support on Mac/Linux in addition to the 6 existing runtimes I support).

Happy mapping!
