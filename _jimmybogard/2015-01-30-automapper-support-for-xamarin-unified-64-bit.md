I pushed out a prerelease package of AutoMapper for Xamarin Unified, including 64-bit support for iOS.

[http://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoMapper/](http://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoMapper/ "http://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoMapper/")

If youâ€™ve had issues with Xamarin on 64-bit iOS, removing an adding the AutoMapper NuGet package reference should do the trick.

And yes, I verified this on a 64-bit device, not the simulator that is full of false hope and broken dreams.

Enjoy!
