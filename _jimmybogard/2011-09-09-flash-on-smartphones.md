I had a great chuckle in this article linked from [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/) about [10 reasons why the Droid Bionic will score over the iPhone 5](http://img.ibtimes.com/www/articles/20110904/208282_apple-iphone-5-motorola-droid-bionic.htm), and one of the reasons being the support of Flash (emphasis mine):

> This is a big advantage an Android systems holds against iPhone. **Flash enriches Web experience**. Any Flash player has to be able to animate on top of video renderings, which makes hardware accelerated video rendering at least not as straightforward as with a purpose-built multimedia player. Therefore, even when only displaying video, Flash players are more resource-intensive than a dedicated video player software. Presently for Apple, only Mac OS 9/X supports Flash. As Droid Bionic comes with the Android OS, **it enjoys the full support of flash**.

Two things here:

  1. Flash degrades, not enriches the web experience
  2. No one enjoys the full support of Flash

I had Flash on my Droid for about a month before I uninstalled it. I had forgotten how much Flash degrades the browsing experience, and I don’t really want my phone battery life to go down because of Flash being more resource-intensive.

Who are these people that actually care about Flash on a phone? It’s just baffling to me.

I really do feel bad for Flash developers, as at least Silverlight-specialized developers will have the .NET Framework to fall back on.
