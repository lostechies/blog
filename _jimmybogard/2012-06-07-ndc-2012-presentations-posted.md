Slides and code are up for my talks at [NDC 2012](http://www.ndcoslo.com/):

[Building External DSLs](https://github.com/jbogard/presentations/tree/master/BuildingExternalDSLs)

[Crafting Wicked Domain Models](https://github.com/jbogard/presentations/tree/master/WickedDomainModels)

NDC also recorded the talks, <del>so when those get released I’ll update this post with the videos as well</del>. Videos below!

[Watch Building External DSLs for Fun and Profit](http://vimeo.com/43536489)

[Watch Crafting Wicked Domain Models](http://vimeo.com/43598193)

The enumeration class I talked about in the domain model talk is on NuGet as the [NuGet package Enumeration](http://nuget.org/packages/Enumeration), so don’t use the one in the talk if you want the latest version of the class.

Thanks, Oslo!!
