Book clubs can be a great way to foster learning and encourage growth on a team.&nbsp; They aren&#8217;t always the best avenue for training, which might include:

  * Formal training 
      * Industry events 
          * Presentations 
              * Brown bag lunches 
                  * etc.</ul> 
                I always enjoyed book clubs because it gave our team a chance to discuss technical topics on a regular basis, sometimes outside of domains we were working on.
                
                ### Planning a book club
                
                If you&#8217;re starting a book club for the first time, you might have to just pick a book that everyone might be interested in without specifically asking anyone.&nbsp; Having the desire to start a book club probably means you already know what deficiencies exist in your team, so you&#8217;re better equipped to pick a book.
                
                In that case, pick a deficiency and find a great book to study.&nbsp; It helps if you&#8217;ve read it beforehand so you know what you&#8217;re getting yourself into.&nbsp; Book clubs need guidance and leadership during meetings to make sure learning and growth take place, and it&#8217;s hard to do if the material is new to everyone.&nbsp; 
                
                Software&nbsp;books usually come in two flavors:
                
                  * Design 
                      * Technology</ul> 
                    Examples of design books might be GoF, anything in the Fowler signature series, Pragmatic Programmer, and other books that are design/principle specific but language/technology agnostic.&nbsp; Technology books are filled with referential material, but not as much guidance on specific subjects like ASP.NET.
                    
                    Some books I&#8217;ve done book clubs on are:
                    
                      * Programming ASP.NET 2.0: Core Reference, Dino Esposito 
                          * The Pragmatic Programmer, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas 
                              * Agile Software Development: Principles, Practices and Patterns, Robert C. Martin 
                                  * Framework Design Guidelines, Cwalina and Abrams 
                                      * Working Effectively with Legacy Code, Michael Feathers 
                                          * Refactoring to Patterns, Joshua Kerievsky</ul> 
                                        As you can see, I&#8217;m heavily weighted to &#8220;Design&#8221; type books, mostly because values, principles, and practices translate well to any new technology.
                                        
                                        ### Book club agenda
                                        
                                        After we select a book, we decide on an agenda and schedule.&nbsp; For internal book clubs, we try to meet once a week at lunch, covering about 30-40 pages a session.&nbsp; We try to get each book club to end after 10-12 weeks, or about 4 months.&nbsp; Everyone reads all the material and discusses it at each meeting.&nbsp; Sometimes we skip chapters if the material isn&#8217;t relevant or particularly insightful.
                                        
                                        Here in the Austin area, we&#8217;re forming an Austin-wide DDD book club to go over Evans&#8217; Domain-Driven Design book.&nbsp; The first thing I do in determining schedule is to break down the parts and chapters into the number of pages they take up:
                                        
                                         ![](http://grabbagoftimg.s3.amazonaws.com/book_club_breakdown.PNG)
                                        
                                        I laid out each of the chapters and noted what page they started on, then calculated the part and chapter lengths in separate columns.&nbsp; Since a single discussion can never cover more than 40 pages in an hour, I used&nbsp;conditional formatting to add bars signifying lengths of the chapter for easier planning.
                                        
                                        Chapter length distribution seemed to be all over the place, so I created a distribution chart to see it a little more clearly:
                                        
                                         ![](http://grabbagoftimg.s3.amazonaws.com/chapter_distribution.PNG)
                                        
                                        This distribution is interesting, as it shows a fairly random distribution of chapter lengths.&nbsp; Not [Gaussian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), not evenly distributed, but a whole bunch of short chapters, a few medium chapters, a few more big chapters, and one off-the chart chapter.&nbsp; Ideally, I&#8217;d have one 40 page chapter per session, but it doesn&#8217;t always work out that way.
                                        
                                        #### Suggested agendas
                                        
                                        Sometimes, especially with the Fowler Signature Series books, the introductory chapters suggest both the important chapters and a suggested study sequence/reading sequence.&nbsp; This can guide the book club agenda.
                                        
                                        In the case of the Evans book, he calls out the &#8220;most important&#8221; chapters, and says that all others can be read out of order, but are meant to be read in their entirety.&nbsp; We might flag some chapters as &#8220;nice to have&#8221; and put them aside, to go back to later if there&#8217;s time.
                                        
                                        ### The meeting
                                        
                                        Book club meetings are meant to be fun, open, inviting, and intellectually appealing.&nbsp; If someone isn&#8217;t engaged, they&#8217;re probably on their laptop or Crack-berry, so keep an eye out for wandering minds.&nbsp; Asking questions tends to get everyone involved, rather than a chorus of &#8220;yeah that makes sense, I agree, echo echo echo&#8221;.
                                        
                                        If you&#8217;re leading the book club, be prepared to read ahead and have a list of talking points before you go in.&nbsp; If anything, the book club leader is charged with creating discussion, but not leading discussion.&nbsp; Talking points tend to enforce focus, so discussions don&#8217;t wind down tangents or social topics for too long.&nbsp; &#8220;OMG did you see last night&#8217;s episode of &#8216;Heroes&#8217;?&#8221; should be kept to a minimum.
                                        
                                        Finally, be aware of your audience.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re covering a topic new to a lot of folks, you might have to do some additional prodding to make sure everyone feels like they contributed.&nbsp; Nobody likes to listen to someone else&#8217;s conversation for an hour (well, almost nobody).
                                        
                                        ### Encouraging self-improvement
                                        
                                        Probably the biggest benefit of book clubs and other organic training like brown bags is that they create a culture of self-improvement.&nbsp; Having the team engaged in book clubs, brown bags, user groups, etc. can set the bar higher when it comes to quality and pride in individual workmanship.&nbsp; Plus, sometimes companies pay for the lunch, so that&#8217;s always good, right?
