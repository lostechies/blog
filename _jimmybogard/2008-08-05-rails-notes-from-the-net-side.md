I&#8217;m starting a small experiment to try out Rails, and I&#8217;m keeping notes as I go.&nbsp; From the first day, here&#8217;s what I have so far:

  * Rails easy to install
  * First MySQL (easy)
  * Ruby, another MSI and go
  * Rails &#8211; from gem
  * All easy to install, basically a one-click installer for all

  * gem installer is crazy nuts
  * Don&#8217;t forget to actually start the MySQL service (duh)
  * rake is also nuts
  * rake db:migrate is my friend

  * The generators trump ridiculous wizards any day of the week
  * We as .NET developers seem to be rather infatuated with projects and wizards

  * Ridiculous how little code is needed
  * The Rails console script is nice to try things out (it&#8217;s an interactive Ruby session)
  * I can&#8217;t tell when I need to restart the console to pick up changes

On that last point, it&#8217;s unbelievably ridiculous how little code is needed.&nbsp; When using Active Record, I don&#8217;t have to create properties and business as I would with any other ORM.&nbsp; This comes from the ingenuity of Rails, combined with the power of Ruby.&nbsp; Literally, an Active Record class could be just two lines of code, with as many properties as you wanted.

  * Convention over configuration, or &#8220;the Rails way&#8221;, took exactly 5 minutes to accept
  * e is a nice text editor, which I need to remember to pay for someday
  * I need to find a good color template for e
  * Remember when using e, to set the tab size to 2, and use soft tabs
  * I&#8217;m surprised how little I care that I&#8217;m not in VS when developing in Rails

I&#8217;m pretty much primarily using VS right now for a handful of features:

  * Compile, run, debug
  * Host ReSharper, TD.NET and VisualSVN (thanks Jeremy for reminding me on the last two)
  * An explorer-ish window to see my files

I got rid of all the other items quite a while back.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t use the Toolbox window, the Server explorer, or the designer (the biggest waste).

I&#8217;m not trading my career for a Rails path, not by a long shot, but I&#8217;m really curious to see what other communities have come up with.&nbsp; More soon&#8230;
