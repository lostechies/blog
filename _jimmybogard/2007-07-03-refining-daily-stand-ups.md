I rediscovered a great article that helped&nbsp;my old&nbsp;[Scrum](http://www.controlchaos.com/)&nbsp;team to refine and improve our daily stand-ups:

<http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html>

Most of the smells mentioned&nbsp;manifested themselves&nbsp;at&nbsp;one time or another, but&nbsp;frequent abuses included:

  * Reporting to the Leader 
      * Stand-up Meeting Starts the Day&#8230; Late 
          * I Can&#8217;t Remember 
              * Problem Solving</ul> 
            I only found this article the first time after our 10th sprint or so, unfortunately.&nbsp; So many activities and artifacts, whether it&#8217;s a process, project management, developing, code, etc. have recognizable smells, it can be difficult to recognize these smells when they exist.
            
            I think I need a new general, all-encompassing&nbsp;smell of &#8220;smell ignorance&#8221;.&nbsp; That&#8217;s when you don&#8217;t know the smells of a particular area, and not knowing the smells limits your ability to improve and succeed.
