I&#8217;ve been in love with Google Calendar for a long time now.&nbsp; I have several calendars I&#8217;m viewing at the same time, including my personal calendar, UT football schedule, and a few others.&nbsp; I always hated having to&nbsp;view two calendars at work, one for my work schedule and one for my Google calendars.

Scott Hanselman mentioned that he [views multiple external calendars inside Outlook 2007](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GettingOrganizedWhileDrinkingFromTheOutlookFireHose.aspx).&nbsp; Several of the external calendars are Google calendars.&nbsp; Outlook 2007 supports any ICAL source, which most online calendar applications provide.&nbsp; It&#8217;s easy to set up, and the instructions can be found here:
