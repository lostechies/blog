I really hate the word &#8220;post-mortem.&#8221;&nbsp; Did someone die?&nbsp; Anyway, I had a great time in my talks over:

  * Legacy Code
  * Intro to C# 3.0
  * Mocks and Stubs

All in all, I felt the Legacy Code talk went the best as it generated the most discussion.&nbsp; I heard much of the same story, failures of intense, lengthy refactoring efforts.&nbsp; Lots of people had the same experience, and these failures led to even deeper trust problems between the business and the developers.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll follow up with my own personal story, but it sounded exactly the same, over and over again.&nbsp; Developers running off for weeks to months, &#8220;improving the design&#8221;, but with little or no business direction in the process.&nbsp; Failure, every time.

The best outcome was several folks asking how to apply these techniques back in their place of work.&nbsp; My answer was start a book club on the Legacy Code book to create awareness of the problem, as well as desire to change.

The other presentations went OK at best.&nbsp; The mocking discussion focused too much on a tool as opposed to great examples of the &#8220;why&#8221;, although the later discussion of the &#8220;why&#8221; finally got some good discussion from the audience.&nbsp; The example I used skewed towards showing specific use cases of mocking and test doubles.&nbsp; But, it was my first presentation on the topic, and it was a great learning experience.&nbsp; Also, it hurt that I was late for the talk because my previous talk ran over.&nbsp; Note to self: never schedule back-to-back talks, and always adhere to the prescribed stop time.

I did get to attend a few other talks, and my favorite was [Gordon Mongomery&#8217;s](http://www.gmeta.com/) &#8220;Coding for stupid users&#8221; talk.&nbsp; Awfully narcissistic and condescending, right?&nbsp; But the actual talk focused on User Experience, or UX.&nbsp; UX is (I believe) the most overshadowed project necessity, even above testing and automation.&nbsp; The best software in the world is useless if the end-user is unable to fathom how to use the darn thing.&nbsp; It&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to use more and more in upcoming projects.

Thanks to the speakers, the organizers, the volunteers, St. Edwards for hosting the conference, and all the attendees that took a Saturday off to geek out.
