I found this cool poster that details the ASP.NET 2.0 page lifecycle, and it includes the [Page](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/428509ah.aspx), [Control](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/428509ah.aspx), and [Adapter](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67276kc5.aspx) events.

[<img style="cursor: pointer" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_poAbnIVuAzE/RngicyuzscI/AAAAAAAAAA8/vnU1l-I_ut8/s400/asppagelifecycle.jpg" alt="" border="0" />](http://bp0.blogger.com/_poAbnIVuAzE/RngicyuzscI/AAAAAAAAAA8/vnU1l-I_ut8/s1600-h/asppagelifecycle.jpg)

As complex as the lifecycle is becoming, this one&#8217;s definitely going on the wall. Also note that since Page inherits Control, all of the Control methods will fire for the Page as well. For more information about the ASP.NET page lifecycle, check out the [MSDN documentation](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx).
