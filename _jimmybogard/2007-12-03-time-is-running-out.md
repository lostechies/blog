I popped open [Windows Live Writer](http://get.live.com/writer/overview) today and got a fun message:

I thought this product was free, and I never paid for anything, so I&#8217;m a little confused how a free product can expire.&nbsp; Live Writer isn&#8217;t supported on Server 2003, which is what I use, so I have to jump through 80 or so hoops to get Live Writer installed on Server 2003.&nbsp; Everything works perfectly fine, but now it seems I will be compelled to jump through the same hoops to upgrade to a version I don&#8217;t need.&nbsp; Fun times.
