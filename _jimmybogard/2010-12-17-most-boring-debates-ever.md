As lived for us every day in Twitter, irc, newsgroups, blog comments, digg, reddit, over and over and over again:

  1. vi vs. emacs
  2. Microsoft vs. Linux
  3. Firefox vs. Chrome
  4. Firefox vs. IE
  5. Firefox vs. Opera
  6. Opera vs. wait, no one cares about Opera
  7. Git vs. Hg
  8. Pairing vs. Not Pairing
  9. Beatles vs. the Stones (or the Who)
 10. Twilight vs. a slow, painful death involving hot pokers through the eyes (obviously a toss-up here)

Any other favorites?
