Check [out the announcement](http://automapper.org/blog/2011/09/22/automapper-20-released/) for details.

Now that everything’s on GitHub, NuGet and TeamCity, this should make newer versions much easier and quicker to release. I hadn’t planned on waiting so long, but upgrading to .NET 4 and adding new features just proved to be a lot of work.

Enjoy!
