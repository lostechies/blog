[Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) [had a recent post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001188.html) that coders are typists first, programmers second:

> Steve [Yegge] and I believe there is nothing more fundamental in programming than the ability to efficiently express yourself through typing. Note that I said "efficiently" not "perfectly". This is about **reasonable competency at a core programming discipline**.

I’m in the camp that I believe that anyone that touches a computer more than once a month should take a basic typing course.&#160; But programmers as typists first?&#160; I did some math on a recent 6 month project, and found that we averaged around 50-70 lines of code per developer per day.&#160; Typing is important to me as a developer, but I still type far more during the course of a given week writing these ridiculously boring, narcissistic blog posts, emails, and [the book](http://www.manning.com/palermo/).

What’s more, the typing skills I do have don’t really help out in the course of the day for those 50-70 lines I do write.&#160; I code in C#, which means at least half the characters I do have to type are:

  * {
  * }
  * <
  * >
  * (
  * )
  * ,

Almost all of which require the shift key and some hand gymnastics to get around.&#160; C# certainly isn’t nearly as wrist-friendly as other languages, but it’s not the most verbose either.

Still, not even most of my keystrokes in Visual Studio are dedicated to typing code.&#160; I have no data to support this, but it seems like half the keystrokes go to a lot of ReSharper shortcuts and a couple Visual Studio ones.&#160; The ReSharper shortcuts still make exclusive use of the Ctrl, Alt and Shift key in various combinations with other keys.&#160; Again, I’m not typing words, but performing key chord combinations.

While typing is important, I’d still say learning design and OO are far more fundamental than typing.&#160; But being a good typist won’t really improve your programming much.&#160; If you’re typing so much that your typing skills are holding you back as a developer, I’d say you’re creating waaay too much code.&#160; That much code is rife with duplication, and you’re not doing enough thinking, designing and analyzing.&#160; With ReSharper, my ability to _create_ code is as optimized as it can be.&#160; There are still improvements to be made, but typing was never what held me back coding.

If you have to touch a computer, yes, learn to type.&#160; But let’s not get carried away that we are typists first, programmers second.&#160; We’re thinkers first, coders second.
