[Jeff](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) had an [interesting post today](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001002.html) on putting programmers into [two bins](http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=79), an 80% and a 20%.&nbsp; The 20% were the alpha-geeks, and the 80% were everyone else,   
&#8220;Morts&#8221; for lack of a better term.&nbsp; One characterization was that the 20% folks let tech-related items push past work hours, while the 80% limited tech stuff to between the hours of 8 and 5.&nbsp; I still don&#8217;t like the idea of pushing people into bins, but there&#8217;s only really 3 types of people I care about:

  * Those that lead 
      * Those that listen 
          * Those that don&#8217;t listen</ul> 
        Although I&#8217;ve had a relatively short experience in development so far, I&#8217;ve only met maybe one or two people that just didn&#8217;t listen.&nbsp; Reasons why they don&#8217;t listen might be indifference,&nbsp;personal, political, etc.&nbsp; These people are very few, maybe 1-5% of the people I&#8217;ve worked with, but those are the ones I work to limit my involvement with.
        
        I want leaders, but not _all_ leaders as too many alpha geeks can lead to severe ego clashes.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want _all_ listeners as someone has to set direction.&nbsp; But as long as I have at least one leader and enough listeners, it&#8217;s enough to deliver.
        
        Also, it&#8217;s a mistake to have a goal to bring the 80% up into the 20%.&nbsp; If someone wants to be in the 20%, fine, but it&#8217;s not a prerequisite for a&nbsp;successful project.&nbsp; Being in the 80% bracket just means you have different priorities, but _not_ that you don&#8217;t care.&nbsp; Saying the 80% just&nbsp;don&#8217;t care is misleading, polarizing and narcissistic.
        
        When I used to interview people, I cared less about years of experience, certifications and the like.&nbsp; Our most successful hires were those who showed a willingness to learn and improve, and an openness to listen and try new approaches.&nbsp; It only took us&nbsp;about 3-6 months to train good mid-level developers, but it can take years (or never) to convince senior-level folks to listen.
