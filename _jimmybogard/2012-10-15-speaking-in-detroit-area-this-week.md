Not because I’m a Tigers or Yankees fan at all, I promise. I’m doing a mini-user group tour this week in the Detroit, MI area.

  * October 16th – [NWNUG](http://nwnug.com/graffiti/) (Northwest Ohio NUG, Toledo, OH) – Functional Testing with ASP.NET MVC
  * October 17th – [MIGANG](http://migang.org/) (Great Lakes Area NUG, Southfield, MI) – Functional Testing with ASP.NET MVC
  * October 18th – [GLUGnet](http://www.glugnet.org/) (Greater Lansing NUG, Okemos, MI) – Keeping Integration Sane with NServiceBus

If you’re in the area, come by and say hello! Thanks to [David Giard](http://davidgiard.com/) for cornering me at [That Conference](http://www.thatconference.com/) and setting this up.

Hope to see you there!
