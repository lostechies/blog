My [Live Writer beta expired](http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/2007/12/time-is-running-out.html) at the beginning of the year, but I&#8217;m still going strong:

I don&#8217;t see the &#8220;Ask Me&#8230;..Never&#8221; button, so I&#8217;ll just click the Later button.&nbsp; It&#8217;s still less work to click a button once a day than it is jumping through the hoops to get Live Writer installed on a Server 2003 machine.&nbsp; I still love the LW, so I&#8217;ll keep clicking away.
