Something I wish I had read years ago (or found out about) is this nice concise list of resources around distributed systems:

[http://dancres.org/reading_list.html](http://dancres.org/reading_list.html "http://dancres.org/reading_list.html")

When I started having issues around 2PC, and twitter was being beyond unhelpful with pointers to actual resources, this list of papers did way more than random internet searching did. One of the more frustrating things about the distributed systems community is that the writings are…well…distributed. You don’t know what questions to ask or even what to begin looking for. This list at least provides a great start.

And for ongoing information, the [high scalability blog](http://highscalability.com/) is also a nice resource. Hopefully this helps the next person with scale problems out!
