This is a bit of a different post for me. I obviously blog and speak a lot about how I build apps at Headspring, and one question I get quite often is ‚Äúcan you make some courses on Pluralsight about these topics?‚Äù Years ago I co-wrote the MVC in Action books, all on my own time. I set out to do the same and create some videos, but life more or less got in the way, and I never was able to publish anything.

So rather than go through a 3rd-party learning platform, which would have to go through an approval process, I‚Äôm building out courseware for Headspring. It‚Äôs focused on how we build MVC applications, but on the new ASP.NET Core 1.0 platform. And rather than trying to do it on my own time, which means it‚Äôll never happen, it‚Äôll be through Headspring, which means that it will happen üôÇ

The idea behind the course is that I‚Äôll walk through how we build applications with ASP.NET Core 1.0, using our toolbelt of AutoMapper, MediatR, Fixie, HtmlTags and more, providing a complete end-to-end guide on both features on the new platform, and how to use them effectively.

I‚Äôll post some more here at [http://hdspr.ng/Project11](http://hdspr.ng/Project11 "http://hdspr.ng/Project11"), just to get things started. Or if you want to go ahead and sign up for the course directly, we‚Äôll have the full series here [http://11xengineering.com/courses/11x-asp-net-core-web-app-development/](http://11xengineering.com/courses/11x-asp-net-core-web-app-development/ "http://11xengineering.com/courses/11x-asp-net-core-web-app-development/").

Either way, I hope you enjoy!
