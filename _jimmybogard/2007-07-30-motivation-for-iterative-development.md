I&#8217;ve been asked by many teams now, &#8220;why iterative development?&#8221;&nbsp; I have a lot of strong, but not well-formed ideas why I like iterative or Agile processes over waterfall processes.&nbsp; But in [Craig Larman&#8217;s](http://www.craiglarman.com/) book   
[&#8220;Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager&#8217;s Guide&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131111558), he provides a nice list of motivations (with explanations and evidence)&nbsp;for choosing iterative development:

  * Iterative development is lower risk; the waterfall is higher risk 
      * Early risk mitigation and discovery 
          * Accommodates and provokes early change; consistent with new product development 
              * Manageable complexity 
                  * Confidence and satisfaction from early, repeated success 
                      * Early partial product 
                          * Relevant progress tracking; better predictability 
                              * Higher quality; less defects 
                                  * Final product better matches true client desires 
                                      * Early and regular process improvement 
                                          * Communication and engagement required 
                                              * &#8220;I&#8217;ll know it when I see it&#8221; required</ul> 
                                            I&#8217;m not a fan of force-fed processes, whether they are Agile or waterfall.&nbsp; Any kind of process needs buy-in from all stakeholders involved in a product or project, from the business to the developers.&nbsp; Craig&#8217;s book supplied the ammunition I needed to gain buy-in from business and development people who were only used to waterfall processes.
                                            
                                            For those interested in introducing iterative development to your team, I&#8217;d start with Craig&#8217;s book, then more detailed books about specific processes you&#8217;re interested in.
