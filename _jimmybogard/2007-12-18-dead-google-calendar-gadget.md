This morning I received an interesting yet disturbing message on the [Google Calendar gadget](http://www.r2unit.com/gmodule/) on my iGoogle home page:

Great gadget that it was, I think I might be a little more discerning about what gadgets I put on the home page.&nbsp; Word of warning, you probably don&#8217;t want to google &#8220;donkey-punching&#8221;, definitely NSFW.&nbsp; It looks like Google changed something, broke the gadget, and the gadget author decided to let everyone know, through an&#8230;.interesting means.
