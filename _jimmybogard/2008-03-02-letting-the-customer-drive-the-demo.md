At the end of an iteration, we have a demo to the customer (and any interested stakeholders) of functionality delivered in that iteration.&nbsp; Something I hadn&#8217;t tried until recently was letting a user or customer drive the demo.&nbsp; There were some minor issues with this approach, but overall I really liked the outcome.

### Original approach

Normally, iteration demos went something like this:

  * Show completed story cards/feature lists
  * Drive through some canned scenarios
  * Try to hit every story completed
  * Collect feedback as we go

While this accomplished our goal of showing the completed product and soliciting feedback, this approach had a few problems:

  * People got bored watching developers use the product
  * Developers don&#8217;t use the product like actual users do
  * Scenarios were geared towards showing features, instead of real user paths
  * Paths were driven away from buggy parts of the system, and centered around &#8220;happy paths&#8221;

Customers felt like they were being shown a list of features checked off, instead a system that was incrementally better than the one shown at the last demo.

### Customer-driven demo

Instead of a developer driving a demo, we tried letting the customer or a user drive the demo.&nbsp; Of course, the guinea pig needed to have some familiarity with what we delivering, but the user chosen was always one that was involved with our iteration.

I was more than a little skeptical of this approach, but once I saw it in action, I think it will be my default style for iteration demos.&nbsp; The benefits we saw were:

  * Demos doubled as user acceptance testing
  * We collected far more meaningful feedback seeing actual use
  * Customer felt in control of the demo, so boredom was greatly reduced
  * Removed some &#8220;us vs. them&#8221; mentality
  * Removed notions of &#8220;you&#8217;re not using it right&#8221;

But perhaps the biggest benefit was that the customer felt something real was delivered.&nbsp; Demos are a time for us as developers to demonstrate that we were accountable for what we committed to deliver.&nbsp; If developers give the demo, there&#8217;s a hint of bias in what is shown, where we could hide areas that weren&#8217;t quite done.

While our system only has one type of user currently, I could see demos in the future where each persona in our system is a different person driving sections of the demo.

Since the feedback gathered, verbal and observational, was of much higher quality in this style of demo, I&#8217;ll use this style as much as possible.
