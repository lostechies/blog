After months of soul-searching, I made the gut-wrenching decision today to upgrade my home PC to Windows XP SP2.

Upgrade from Vista, that is.

I&#8217;m completely convinced that Vista is not designed to run on single-core/processor machines.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve run Vista on work machines without any hiccups, with Aero Glass going full on.&nbsp; I thought I had a semi-decent home PC:

  * AMD Athlon XP 2800+ 
      * 2 GB RAM </ul> 
    Alas, it was not enough to net me more than about 2.9 on the Windows Experience Index.&nbsp; UAC annoys the hell out of me, most file operations take forever, I&#8217;m denied access to do simple operations, like creating a folder on my D: drive.&nbsp; At work, I&#8217;ll turn all of these safety features off, as I&#8217;m okay running with scissors in a development environment.&nbsp; I have no idea how a home user deals with all of it, I sure couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; opefully Vista&#8217;s SP1 will fix these issues.
