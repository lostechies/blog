Has anyone else that attended ALT.NET feel under the weather this week?&nbsp; I was fine before the conference, then felt like crap afterwards.

I have a feeling that it was because of the germ-sponge getting passed around at the closing session:

It was orange at the beginning, but quickly took a brown hue as it went around the room.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll bring some rubber gloves next time&#8230;
