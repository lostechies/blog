As was announced on [Jeffrey&#8217;s blog](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo), Headspring is [hiring Extreme Programmers](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2008/03/21/extreme-programmers-wanted-in-austin-tx.aspx).&nbsp; We have several positions to fill, so if you&#8217;re interested in joining the [leading agile consulting company in Austin](http://www.headspringsystems.com/), please apply through [our job posting](http://www.headspringsystems.com/insideheadspring/join_our_team20080320.jsp).

We&#8217;re a small company with a startup feel, but without the baggage of a startup.&nbsp; We practice TDD, we&#8217;re co-located, continuous integration is a given, and we work in 1-2 week iterations.&nbsp; If any of this means anything to you, we&#8217;re interested in talking to you.
