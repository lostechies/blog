Anyone familiar with [Superman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman)&nbsp;also knows about [Bizarro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro), a doppelganger of Superman.&nbsp; Bizarro looks like Superman, but is opposite in every way.&nbsp; Instead of saving people, he kills them.&nbsp; Instead of eloquent speech, he talks like&nbsp;Tarzan.&nbsp; He&#8217;s not from Earth, but from Htrea (Earth backwards, clever).&nbsp; And so on.

A colleague reminded me again of the challenges of explaining iterative development to a manager who had been living with waterfall for many years.&nbsp; The timeboxing concept came through, but iterative and incremental, not so much.

We drew our original six-month schedule on the board and chopped it up into monthly iterations, saying we would deliver at the end of each month.&nbsp; We should have been more specific on what &#8220;deliver&#8221; meant, because this was what the manager then suggested:

  * Iteration 1: Envisioning 
      * Iteration 2: Planning 
          * Iteration 3: Development 
              * Iteration 4: Refactoring 
                  * Iteration 5: Testing 
                      * Iteration 6: Stabilization</ul> 
                    Each iteration is timeboxed, which is good, but this is just slapping arbitrary exit points on waterfall.&nbsp; Not iterative, but bizarro-tive development.&nbsp; Once we explained further, this was the next suggestion:
                    
                      * Iteration 1 
                          * Week 1: Envisioning/Planning 
                              * Week 2: Development 
                                  * Week 3: Refactoring 
                                      * Week 4: Testing/Stabilization</ul> 
                                      * Iteration 2 &#8211; lather, rinse, repeat</ul> 
                                    Still not _exactly_ what we were talking about.&nbsp; True iterative development has most or all aspects happen every day, and some points in the iteration some things will happen more than others.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re never doing just one aspect, and slapping phases into iterations isn&#8217;t iterative development, but it&#8217;s what Bizarro might do.
