Managerial styles regarding motivation interest me from time to time, and I always like to refer to a series of articles from [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/):

        In these articles, Joel describes a set of managerial styles and what kinds of motivation they create.&nbsp; Whenever I&#8217;m trying to introduce different practices or ideas, I&#8217;ve always kept these styles in the back of my mind, as it&#8217;s very easy to drop into a negative style without noticing.
        
        The idea behind the carrot or the stick is that there are basically two ways to motivate a&nbsp;mule to do anything.&nbsp; You can either dangle a carrot in front of him, to entice him to go forward, or beat him with a stick, to punish him for not going forward.
        
        ### The Carrot
        
        Relating a carrot to a development team, it could be financial or other kinds of rewards for following a certain practice.&nbsp; Practices could be lines of code written, tests introduced, pages of documentation written, etc.&nbsp; If the developer meets some bar, they will be rewarded.&nbsp; The problem is that this style creates extrinsic motivation.&nbsp; That is, I&#8217;m not doing a certain action because it matches my values and goals, but meets someone else&#8217;s seemingly arbitrary measurement.
        
        What happens in practice&nbsp;is that developers are smart, and will do only what is minimally required to meet the goal if the&nbsp;measurement is a fixed point.&nbsp; If the reward is on a sliding scale, developers will&nbsp;game the system, play the numbers game, and make themselves appear&nbsp;better in the eyes of the measurement, regardless if the underlying system has actually improved.
        
        Consider paying employees or contractors based on lines of code written.&nbsp; The problem with that measurement is that the most maintainable, clear,&nbsp;soluble systems are usually an order of magnitude _less_ code than a poorly&nbsp;written system.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this measurement, the poorly&nbsp;written system will net the developer a greater financial reward, so there is no motivation to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;better system.
        
        ### The Stick
        
        The opposite of the reward would&nbsp;be the punishment.&nbsp; If a&nbsp;developer does not perform a specific action, they will be punished in some form, whether it&#8217;s verbal, monetary,&nbsp;lower review scores, etc.&nbsp; Again, this creates extrinsic motivation.&nbsp; The developer is smart&nbsp;enough to do just enough to not get punished, without any&nbsp;regards to the values behind the actions/processes.
        
        Suppose we mandate code comments as part of our review process.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t have your code commented, your review score is lowered.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not possible to measure&nbsp;the quality of the comments, but just&nbsp;that they exist.&nbsp; What would happen would be the comments would exist, but they would be sloppy, misleading, and in some cases, completely incorrect.&nbsp; The developer doesn&#8217;t care why code comments are valuable and necessary, but only that if they don&#8217;t put them in, their annual review score will suffer.
        
        ### A third option: shared values
        
        The final option is the &#8220;identify&#8221; style.&nbsp; This is where I get the&nbsp;mule to identify with my goals, share them, and move forward together.&nbsp; When I introduce new ideas, I usually start with the values I&#8217;m trying to reinforce.&nbsp; We can argue over the validity of practices and processes, but it&#8217;s easy to see whether or not a practice supports a value.&nbsp;&nbsp;A development team does a much better job&nbsp;determining if a&nbsp;practice doesn&#8217;t do a good job supporting our values than quibbling over individual practices.
        
        The only times shared values have worked for me is in close-knit, collaborative development teams.&nbsp; If developers are treated like commodities, only the carrot and the stick will work, with uninspiring results.&nbsp; With a highly collaborative team, as agile practices reinforce, the team not only better identifies with internal values, but external ones as well since each member is acquainted with a shared value system.&nbsp; When management has a process requirement, it would have a much higher success rate within the team if the team can identify with the values and goals behind the requirement.
        
        ### Final thoughts
        
        Certain styles are needed for certain contexts and people.&nbsp; If a highly collaborative team is possible and obtainable, the &#8220;identify&#8221; style will reap the greatest rewards.&nbsp; Most developers are smart enough to game systems based on extrinsic motivation, and&nbsp;will welcome opportunities for intrinsic motivation.&nbsp; If someone refuses to respond to shared values, that&#8217;s when the carrot or stick needs to come out.&nbsp; It&#8217;s only when dealing with a jackass that a carrot or stick is needed.
