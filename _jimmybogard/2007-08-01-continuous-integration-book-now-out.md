I just read from [Martin Fowler&#8217;s Bliki](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/)&nbsp;that a new book in his signature series is out, [&#8220;Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk&#8221;](http://martinfowler.com/books.html#duvall).&nbsp; If you&#8217;re not familiar with [Fowler&#8217;s signature series](http://www.awprofessional.com/series/series.asp?ser=335487), check out the books on that list:

                                    That&#8217;s quite an impressive list of books to be in one series.&nbsp; Many of these books follow the &#8220;[Duplex Book](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DuplexBook.html)&#8221; pattern, where the book is split into two sections.&nbsp; The first is a smaller section designed to be read cover-to-cover.&nbsp; The next section(s) provide prescriptive guidance that can be read end-to-end, or in bits and pieces as necessary.
                                    
                                    As an aside, I&#8217;ve felt that nothing impacts or enables success quite as much as continuous integration.&nbsp; In my (admittedly limited) experience, CI seems to open the doors to other Agile practices like &#8220;Whole Team&#8221;, unit testing and test-driven development, pair programming, and others.&nbsp; CI is the low-hanging fruit that solves many obvious and common problems in development, while subtly introducing the team to several core Agile values, like communication and feedback.
