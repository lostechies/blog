I&#8217;ve had the idea in my head to rank myself on a scale of 1 to 10 for my C# skills. I believe there&#8217;s a lot to the language and most people would probably overrate themselves. I thought I&#8217;d jot them down, share them, and see what others thought. Here is what I have so far:

  1. you can write simple expressions
  2. you can write a series of statements
  3. you can write small programs
  4. you rely on language features to improve code
  5. you use a productivity tool like ReSharper, but rarely get code improvement suggestions
  6. you can <del datetime="2012-06-06T06:10:56+00:00">override</del><ins datetime="2012-06-06T06:10:56+00:00">overload</ins> an operator without having to look it up
  7. you understand all the keywords in the language and how they&#8217;re used
  8. you can confidently talk about the internal implementations of how c# works
  9. you have an opinion about new features being developed and are providing feedback
 10. you are Jon Skeet

Thoughts?
