Thanks again to the Los Techies guys for inviting me to blog with them. I was privileged to meet several of them at [Kaizenconf](http://kaizenconf.com/) in Austin, TX last fall and I couldn&#8217;t hope for a better group of talented people to have my name next to. As [Tim Barcz](http://www.devlicio.us/blogs/tim_barcz) said in [Jason&#8217;s Welcome Post](/blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2009/01/05/pablo-welcomes-chris-missal.aspx), I&#8217;m relatively unknown at this point, so I&#8217;ll tell you a little more about what interests me and what you can expect from me.

I do a lot of development in C# ASP.Net (lately working with MVC) and I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time working with [jQuery](http://jquery.com) over the last year or so. Lately I&#8217;ve been trying to concentrate on Architecture & Patterns and [SOLID principles](/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/03/07/pablo-s-topic-of-the-month-march-solid-principles.aspx). Additional topics you can expect from me:

  * I&#8217;ve started playing around with [Fluent NHibernate](http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/) and AutoMapping
  * Admittedly I&#8217;m not good at [RhinoMocks](http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx), but I&#8217;m using it quite a bit and learning more each day.
  * I&#8217;m a big fan of CSS even though I&#8217;m not artistic.

When I&#8217;m not behind a couple of monitors buried in code I enjoy Frisbee and disc golf, bowling, watching movies and select TV shows (The Office & Arrested Development mainly).
