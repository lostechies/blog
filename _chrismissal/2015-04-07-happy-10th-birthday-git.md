If you read this blog, you&#8217;ve probably already heard that today marks the 10 year anniversary of Git&#8217;s first commit (of its own code). My buddy [Ryan](https://lostechies.com/ryanrauh/) and I decided to build this really cool web site to celebrate, but ideas are easy and execution can be tough. We have a simple static that references the first commit:

<http://gitbirthday.com>

The fun feature we didn&#8217;t get around to adding was an interactive page to display the most recent commit, but always 10 years in the past. Even though we didn&#8217;t get around to completing that before the actual &#8220;10th birthday&#8221;, we decided to make the source open so anybody can give back to git with a pull request for neat features you have.

Also, thanks to Linus, Junio, and the rest of the contributors for giving us git!
