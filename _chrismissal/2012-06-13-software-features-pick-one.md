A few months back I saw a tweet that stuck with me. It was from [Alton Brown](https://twitter.com/altonbrown). I&#8217;m not a foodie, but for some reason, this one stuck in my head. I think it&#8217;s because it resonated in other parts of my life. Mr. Brown said:

> You can have your food plentiful, cheap, or good&#8230;pick any two.
  
> [@altonbrown](https://twitter.com/altonbrown/status/192093425397542912)

While I completely agree with this postulate, again, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of food. I like eating, I enjoy good, but I can&#8217;t tell you the difference between what&#8217;s good and bad. I just know what I like and what I don&#8217;t like (which isn&#8217;t much).

This statement stuck with me because I feel there&#8217;s the same trade-off in software. Here&#8217;s my quote:

> You can build something cheap, fast, good looking, reliable, marketable, trendy, usable or useful&#8230; **pick one**.

What do you think? Not too far off, am I?
