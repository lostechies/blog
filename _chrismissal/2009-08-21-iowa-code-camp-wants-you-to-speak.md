<img style="float: right;margin-left: 15px;margin-right: 15px" src="//lostechies.com/chrismissal/files/2011/03/iccLogo.png" />[Iowa Code Camp](http://iowacodecamp.com) is back at it again! The official call for [speakers](http://bit.ly/16RcAz) has been [announced](http://devlicio.us/blogs/tim_barcz/archive/2009/08/20/invoke-callfor-gt-speakers-for-iowacodecamp-version-4.aspx). Last code camp, I was given the priviledge to present A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Unit Testing with [Tim Barcz](http://devlicio.us/blogs/Tim_Barcz/) and fellow Patron of Pablo [Keith Dahlby](/members/dahlbyk/default.aspx) spoke on&nbsp;_Leveraging .NET 3.5 Language Features in SharePoint Development_&nbsp;and gave an _Introduction to F#_.&nbsp;

This fall&#8217;s camp will be at the [DMACC](http://www.dmacc.edu/) campus in West Des Moines, IA. If you&#8217;re not interested in giving a presentation but would like to attend, be sure to stay informed on the announcement for registration. This will be broadcasted when speakers have been selected from those that have submitted. (Call for speakers lasts through Sept 30th).
