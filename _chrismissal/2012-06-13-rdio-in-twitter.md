Maybe it&#8217;s old news, but I can&#8217;t find anything. I recently posted a link to an Artist in Rdio inside a tweet and it showed up playable to me. I can only assume that it&#8217;s playable to anybody with a current subscription to Rdio.

## Rdio in Twitter

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-242" title="Rdio in Twitter" src="http://clayvessel.org/clayvessel/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rdio-in-twitter1.png" alt="" width="526" height="380" srcset="http://clayvessel.org/clayvessel/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rdio-in-twitter1.png 526w, http://clayvessel.org/clayvessel/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rdio-in-twitter1-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" />](http://clayvessel.org/clayvessel/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rdio-in-twitter1.png)

I&#8217;m a user and fan of Rdio, so I think this is cool.

## Rdio API in the Browser

I also found out recently that Rdio has a pretty potent API and developer program. Check out these links:

  * [Rdio Console](http://rdio.github.com/playback-console/) &#8211; If you&#8217;re logged in, you can run commands to Rdio through the browser!
  * [Rdio Developers](http://developer.rdio.com/) &#8211; The place to start if you&#8217;re thinking about using some codez to talk to Rdio.

I hope you found something useful here, just sharing my recent revelations!
