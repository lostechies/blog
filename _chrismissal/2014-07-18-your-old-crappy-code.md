If you&#8217;re not new to software, you&#8217;ve probably come across some old code of yours and thought:

> Oh snap! What is this? What was I thinking?

I&#8217;ve done it. My friends and colleagues have done. You&#8217;ve probably done it as well.

Recently some friends and former co-workers of mine reached out and asked if I&#8217;d like to help out part time doing some front-end work. I thought it might be fun to do some contract work on the side and even more fun to work with awesome people I haven&#8217;t worked with in about 2.5 years.

Last night, I came across some old JavaScript of mine, here were my reactions:

  1. **Nostalgia:** <quote>Oh hey! I wrote this!</quote>
  2. **Shame:** <quote>Wow, this isn&#8217;t very good. I can do much better now. How embarrassing to think that I once thought this was production worthy.<quote>
  3. **Sleep:** I actually went to sleep because it was late.
  4. **Pride:** That code still works fine even though it&#8217;s not super pretty. Even better, since I wrote it over 5 years ago, by my calculations it&#8217;s been successfully executed over 7 billion times!

I woke up feeling much better about my &#8220;not perfect&#8221; code. It&#8217;s not about beauty, it&#8217;s about value. So next time you find that ugly, embarrassing code you wrote 1 year, 5 years, or even further back in time. If it&#8217;s still in production and providing value, take some pride in it!
