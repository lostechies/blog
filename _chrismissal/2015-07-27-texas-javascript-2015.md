Another edition of [Texas JavaScript (TXJS)](https://2015.texasjavascript.com) was held in downtown Austin on Friday, July 24th.

I wanted to share some thoughts and notes from the talks.

## The Scary Stuff

  * Check out [Simon Swain&#8217;s](https://twitter.com/simon_swain) [Cold War](https://simonswain.com/coldwar)! Do it now, it&#8217;s incredible
  * [Yan](https://twitter.com/bcrypt) told us about [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), a new, free, automated, and open Certificate Authority
  * [Jed&#8217;s](https://twitter.com/jedschmidt) [talk on inline styles](http://slides.com/jedschmidt/america-inline#/) was thought provoking and very entertaining. Oh, he was defending them for what it&#8217;s worth.

## UX & Performance

These talks were great, they all focused on people, not developers. It&#8217;s great to be reminded that what we do as developers is pointless if there&#8217;s nobody using what we build.

  * [Michelle](https://twitter.com/hazelcough) talked about building component libraries to be able to give users a consistent and comfortable feel (and providing that value faster)
  * [Andy](https://twitter.com/andydavies) discussed the benefits and value of delivering faster web experiences with HTTP/2.
  * [Alice](https://twitter.com/alicebartlett) showed us the troubles and successes of making web sites usable. And not just &#8220;nice&#8221;, but actually usable for all types of users from any background imaginable. Not everybody uses the web like you and I.

## Framework Unshootout

[Brian](https://twitter.com/briantford), [Tom](https://twitter.com/tomdale), and [Pete](https://twitter.com/floydophone) got together back to back to back, and talked about how the Angular, Ember, and React teams are all actually on the same team (more or less). They&#8217;ve all <del datetime="2015-07-27T16:52:27+00:00">stolen</del> borrowed ideas from each other, and they&#8217;re all moving forward together, not in spite of one another.

## The Once & Future Web

Future! Here we got schooled on how to use some new toys. [Rushaine](https://twitter.com/copasetickid) talked ES6, [Mat &#8220;Wilto&#8221;](https://twitter.com/wilto) convinced me that images are ruining the web and need to be fixed, and [Jake](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake) told us, among many other progressive enhancements, how a network connection is something to be considered as a feature you might not have when building web apps.

## Expand Your Mind

Our minds were expanded and partially blown by [Jenna](https://twitter.com/zeigenvector) explaining the similarities between JavaScript and our brains&#8217; language processing. If that was enough to melt your mind, [David](https://twitter.com/swannodette) showed us the awesome ClojureScript compiler (I have a lot to learn here). Finally, [Jenn](https://twitter.com/jennschiffer) schooled and entertained us with arrays. Trust me, it was great!

## Awards

  * Best phone call: [Alex](https://twitter.com/SlexAxton) & Pizza Delivery
  * Best wardrobe change under pressure: [Alice Bartlett](https://twitter.com/alicebartlett)
  * Best Game: [Cold War](https://simonswain.com/coldwar)
  * Best Slide Images: [Jenna](https://twitter.com/zeigenvector) for Adventure Time
