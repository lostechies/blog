I&#8217;m getting excited for [St. Louis Day of .Net](http://stlouisdayofdotnet.com), August 28th-29th! We have two <a>Los Techies</a> members speaking at this event. [Chris Patterson](/blogs/chris_patterson/default.aspx) is speaking on [Event Driven Architecture](http://stlouisdayofdotnet.com/SessionDetail.aspx?SessionID=40) and [Keith Dahlby](/blogs/dahlbyk/default.aspx) is speaking on [Linq Internals](http://stlouisdayofdotnet.com/SessionDetail.aspx?SessionID=34).

It is a two-day conference this year and is full of good speakers (see previous paragraph). In addition to our own <a>Los Techies</a> speakers, a couple other friends of mine are presenting sessions as well. [Tim Barcz](http://devlicio.us/blogs/tim_barcz/) is presenting on &#8220;[Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Unit Tests](http://stlouisdayofdotnet.com/SessionDetail.aspx?SessionID=21)&#8220;, a talk I co-presented with him at [Iowa Code Camp](http://iowacodecamp.com) in the spring of 2009. Additionally, [Dru Sellers](http://codebetter.com/blogs/dru.sellers/) will be there presenting on &#8220;[An Introduction to Inversion of Control](http://stlouisdayofdotnet.com/SessionDetail.aspx?SessionID=53)&#8220;.

It looks like a great event to attend if you&#8217;re in the area. For more information, visit <http://stlouisdayofdotnet.com> and follow [@stldodn](http://twitter.com/stldodn) on [Twitter](http://twitter.com).
