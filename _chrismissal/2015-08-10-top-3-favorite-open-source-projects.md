Tough question right?! Before getting into my list, some background:

[Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) came up with an interesting use for GitHub. You can fork a repo, and nearly instantly have your own [AMA page](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama) using issues. Simple concept, but lots of fun!

I decided to give this a go and received a [really great question](https://github.com/ChrisMissal/ama/issues/10) from [Una Kravets](https://github.com/una).

I gave it a bit of thought and came up with four Top 3 lists. I&#8217;d like to share because I&#8217;m interested in what others think of this question:

## What are You Top 3 Favorite Open Source Projects?

Feel free to share here or on my AMA question above as a comment. (Or just write your own blog post!) Anyway, here are mine right now:

## My Favorite Projects to Work On

  1. [RoundhousE](https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse) – I&#8217;ve been using RH for a long, long time and it has made my experience working with databases so much nicer! I recently started helping out with maintenance, while challenging, it&#8217;s still rewarding to see the project stay alive and healthy.
  2. [Quiche](https://github.com/chrismissal/quiche) – This one might only be used by me, but I really like(d) building it and working on it.
  3. [Cake](https://github.com/cake-build/cake) – This one is still new to me, but it&#8217;s been an absolute pleasure working on. Great group of contributors and excellent code/docs/etc.

## The Projects I Most Enjoy Using

  1. [HuBot](https://github.com/github/hubot) – My coworkers and I frequently add useful and goofy scripts for HuBot in our HipChat rooms. It&#8217;s a lovely API and super easy and fun to work with.
  2. [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) – React has worked very well so far with the projects we build at work. I also really dig the opinions on how the framework should be used, it&#8217;s wonderful.
  3. [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) – It didn&#8217;t take much use of Atom for it to replace all my other editors. I love the power that it gives me and the fact that it&#8217;s open source and wildly extensible.

## Projects that Have Benefitted Me Most

  1. [AutoMapper](https://github.com/automapper/automapper) – I&#8217;ve been using AutoMapper for years now and it&#8217;s made my life better by saving me thousands of unnecessary keystrokes.
  2. [Fixie](https://github.com/fixie/fixie) – Fixie is the test framework I didn&#8217;t know I needed until I started using it on personal projects. I love having the control of testing my code the way I want to.
  3. [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/mediatr) – A simple project that implements a simple pattern. Like the previous two, this gets out of the way and makes coding more productive and fun.

## Projects That Have Helped Others

  1. [WebApiContrib](https://github.com/webapicontrib) – A few people got together and built a small library of useful patterns that have tons of downloads (for me anyway). I&#8217;m judging by download counts that this is a success. And that makes me happy!
  2. [Up-For-Grabs.net](http://up-for-grabs.net) – I love spreading the OSS love and this site that my friend Keith built is perfect for it. I&#8217;m always looking for more ways to share!
  3. [Formo](https://github.com/chrismissal/Formo) – This only makes the list because it&#8217;s the most popular project that I run by myself. I do like it and still use it so I have to put it in one of these lists.

If you decide to type up your own list(s) I&#8217;d love to read it!
