Today in a meeting I heard: _&ldquo;We can provide a workaround for you&rdquo;_ and immediately wrote down the title of this post in my notepad. Obviously, <a title="Workaround From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaround" target="_blank">workaround</a> is not a <a title="Four-letter word From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-letter_word" target="_blank">four-letter word</a> in reality, but does have nearly the same meaning as the actual four letter word &ldquo;hack&rdquo;. If anybody tells you this, stop them in their tracks and ask them to try again.

How I&rsquo;ve gone this long without ranting about the overuse and misunderstanding of this word for so long, I&rsquo;ll never know; I must have had it beaten into my ears for so long it lost its meaning. Don&rsquo;t confuse this with providing an actual solution to a problem, but by proposing a workaround, you&rsquo;re really proposing to temporarily fix a problem with up-front knowledge of low quality work.

I&rsquo;ve heard this word a lot in my career and I&rsquo;ve decided it now deserves the same feeling of disgust the word &ldquo;hack&rdquo; gives me. Hopefully you&rsquo;re on the same page as me. If you feel that a &ldquo;workaround&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t all that bad, or that it has its place in software development, at least call it what it is.
