Just a heads up for anybody that hasn&#8217;t seen it, but [WebApiContrib](http://webapicontrib.github.com/) (the community contributions to ASP.NET&#8217;s new Web API framework) is alive and kicking! [Pedro Reys](https://twitter.com/#!/pedroreys) wrote up an **[excellent introduction](http://bit.ly/webapicontrib)** about what&#8217;s going on with the project(s), where we are, and what we have left to do.

If you haven&#8217;t gotten a chance to look at [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) yet, please do so, it&#8217;s a very promising addition to the newly open sourced ASP.NET web stack. As always, we&#8217;d love to get some feedback and contributions, let us know what you think and how we can improve our project!
