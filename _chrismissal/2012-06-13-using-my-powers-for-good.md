When people ask me what I do, more often than not, I tell them that I am lucky because I get paid to do what I love, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d do even if I didn&#8217;t have a job. I like to build things with computers. I usually do this in the form of web sites or computer programs.

### The Idea

[<img class="size-full wp-image-195 alignright" title="Me at NewBoCo in Sept 2011" src="http://clayvessel.org/clayvessel/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/chris-at-newboco.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="384" srcset="http://clayvessel.org/clayvessel/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/chris-at-newboco.jpg 256w, http://clayvessel.org/clayvessel/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/chris-at-newboco-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" />](http://clayvessel.org/clayvessel/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/chris-at-newboco.jpg)

Last summer when I was living in Cedar Rapids, IA, there was an event on September 2nd called [NewBoFest](http://www.newbofest.com/) that sounded really great. I decided to help out and volunteer some of my time with planning, setup and teardown of NewBoCo, the conference of ideas and stories, shared by the community for the community. At the end of NewBoCo, there was a final session where anybody could spend 1 minute on stage talking about anything that they wanted that was related to the local community (or really anything community related in general). I pitched an idea that I had been thinking about for a couple months. The idea was one of gathering together developers and designers to help out local charities and non-profits with their tech needs. Building software and web sites because most can&#8217;t afford to pay much for these things. After telling this idea to an auditorium full of people I decided to make it a reality. I began researching and lo and behold, this exact idea is called a [GiveCamp](http://givecamp.org/)!

## Central Texas Give Camp

Since NewBoCo, some things have changed for me, I took a new gig at [Headspring](http://www.headspring.com) in Austin! After only about 2 or 3 weeks into my job, I was informed that we would be hosting a GiveCamp at our new office, yet another sign that made me feel good about my job switch and the 1,000 mile move. ðŸ™‚
