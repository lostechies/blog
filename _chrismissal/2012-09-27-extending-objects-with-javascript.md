I have been a fan of JavaScript for quite some time, but mostly as an outsider looking in. I feel like I understand many of the concepts and can be fairly dangerous, but recently I have made it a point to really learn this stuff inside and out.

It didn&#8217;t take long before I realized that object extension is very powerful in dynamic languages and JavaScript pretty damn good at this. Here are my notes on extending objects in JavaScript with various frameworks:

  1. [Extending Objects in jQuery](http://lostechies.com/chrismissal/2012/09/27/extending-objects-in-jquery/ "Extending Objects in jQuery")
  2. [Extending Objects in Ext JS](http://lostechies.com/chrismissal/2012/10/02/extending-objects-in-ext-js/ "Extending Objects in Ext JS")
  3. [Extending Objects in Dojo](http://lostechies.com/chrismissal/2012/10/03/extending-objects-in-dojo/ "Extending Objects in Dojo")
  4. [Extending Objects in Underscore](http://lostechies.com/chrismissal/2012/10/05/extending-objects-in-underscore/ "Extending Objects in Underscore")

I hope this series of posts is helpful to you too. If not, leave me some feedback and I can modify it to better, thanks!
