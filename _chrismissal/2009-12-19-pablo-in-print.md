I just wanted to share with you that <a title="Jason Meridth" href="http://jason.lostechies.com" target="_blank">Jason</a> has posted some links to print articles and/or books that our bloggers have had published.

<a href="http://chadmyers.lostechies.com/" target="_blank">Chad Myers</a>, <a href="http://eric.lostechies.com/" target="_blank">Eric Anderson</a>, <a href="http://jimmybogard.lostechies.com/" target="_blank">Jimmy Bogard</a> and <a href="http://derickbailey.lostechies.com/" target="_blank">Derick Bailey</a> have headed up this list with books and articles from over the last year or so. Keep up the great work guys!
