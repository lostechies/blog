A while ago, I was looking through some C# code and came across something fun that was being added by [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/).

In comments, the words &#8220;gold&#8221; and &#8220;silver&#8221; are underlined with that color. I don&#8217;t know if this is just an [easter egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)) or if there&#8217;s more to it. I&#8217;m curious if anybody else has noticed this or other words. Ideally, this is some sort of golden ticket added by [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com) and I win a prize visit to the &#8220;factory&#8221;! ðŸ˜‰
