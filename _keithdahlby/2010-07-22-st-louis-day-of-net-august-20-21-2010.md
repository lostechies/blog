One of my favorite developer events last year was [St. Louis Day of .NET](http://www.stlouisdayofdotnet.com/). Not only were the facilities (<span class="ciinfo right">Ameristar Casino) top-notch, but there were a ton of great sessions and I got to pick the brains of some really sharp people. This year&#8217;s event looks to be even better, with a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stlouisdayofdotnet.com/Sessions.aspx">huge variety of sessions</a> on principles, practices and plenty of programming. I will be presenting two sessions:</span>

### Dynamic .NET Demystified

Dynamic .NET has gone mainstream with the recent promotion of the Dynamic Language Runtime into .NET 4. This session will discuss what the DLR is, how it works with C# 4 and Visual Basic 10, and why this doesn&#8217;t mean C# has jumped the shark. We will also look at some ways in which these features can be used to solve real-world problems.

### LINQ Internals II: System.Interactive

System.Interactive is a library distributed with Microsoft&#8217;s Reactive Extensions, currently available on DevLabs, which provides a number of useful extensions to the LINQ Standard Query Operators. These extensions include operators to add and contain side effects, handle exceptions, generate and combine sequences, and much more. This session will review the new operators and discuss interesting problems they can be used to solve. Note that Rx is available for .NET 3.5 SP1, Silverlight 3 and .NET 4.0, so this session is not just for those developing on the bleeding edge.

## Free Stuff

The organizers were kind enough to provide speakers with some discount codes, so I figured this is as good a place as any to give those out. Two lucky commenters will get a code worth $75 off the cover price, with the grand prize being _free admission_. All you have to do is [leave a comment](http://solutionizing.net/2010/07/21/st-louis-day-of-dot-net-2010/ "Cross-posted on my blog") (with valid e-mail address) convincing me that you deserve these rich rewards over my other suitors. And if your reasons are all terrible, I&#8217;ll ask random.org. Deadline is 23:59 CDT on Monday, July 26th.

Hope to see you there!
