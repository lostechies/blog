Every January a swarm of geeks descend on the [Kalahari Resort](http://www.kalahariresorts.com/oh/) in Sandusky, OH for [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/), a top-notch cross-platform, family-friendly developer conference. This year&#8217;s event features an impressive [session list](http://codemash.org/Sessions) including presentations by [Scott Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/ "Scott Hanselman"), [Jon Skeet](http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/ "Jon Skeet"), [Glenn Block](http://twitter.com/gblock) of [CodeBetter](http://codebetter.com/glennblock/), [Rob Reynolds](http://twitter.com/ferventcoder) of [Devlicious](http://devlicious.com/blogs/rob_reynolds/)&#8230;the list goes on. And that&#8217;s just in the .NET track! Also on that list you&#8217;ll find three sessions featuring members of Los Techies:

I had a great time at CodeMash last year, and this year is shaping up to be even better. [Registration](http://codemash.org/register) opens _today_ (Oct. 24) at 10:24 AM EDT and you&#8217;ll want to reserve your spot soonâ€”last year&#8217;s event sold out in less than four days!

If you do make it to the event, please ping me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dahlbyk) so we can meet up!
