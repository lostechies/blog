As open source gains more and more traction <del>in the .NET space</del> everywhere, a common question that keeps coming up is &#8220;How can I help?&#8221; To answer that question, a growing number of projects are tagging specific bugs and feature requests as good places for a new contributor to start. The tag to identify such tasks has not been [standardized](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/11/04/avoid-premature-standardization.aspx "Phil Haack: Avoid Premature Standardization"), but you should be able to figure it out&#8230;if you go and look.

To make discovering such projects easier, I&#8217;ve whipped together a site (page) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dahlbyk/up-for-grabs.net): [Up For Grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/). I&#8217;ve seeded the site with a few project links, but I hope over time we can grow this into a resource for newcomers to the open source scene to discover projects and get guidance on how to [jump in](http://nikcodes.com/2013/05/10/new-contributor-jump-in/ "Nik Molnar: New Contributor? Jump In!")!

Thanks to [Scott](http://www.hanselman.com/ "Scott Hanselman") for the nudge to get this started.

**Update:** Though the genesis of this site was a discussion on challenges facing the .NET open source community, I&#8217;ve come to realize that barriers to entry for new contributors exist across the entire open source ecosystem. So, if you run (or contribute to) _any_ open source project that 1) has bugs and feature requests that you would consider &#8220;up for grabs&#8221; for new contributors, and 2) are interested in mentoring new contributors on their way to becoming great contributors, please [add your project to the list](https://github.com/dahlbyk/up-for-grabs.net/edit/gh-pages/index.html "Edit up-for-grabs.net (GitHub login required)").
