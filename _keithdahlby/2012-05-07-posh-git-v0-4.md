I figure a year between [releases](https://lostechies.com/keithdahlby/2011/04/06/posh-git-release-v0-3/ "posh-git Release v0.3") is plenty, so I&#8217;ve tagged a [v0.4 release](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/tree/v0.4 "posh-git v0.3 on GitHub") of [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git "posh-git on GitHub").

Really the notion of versions for a bunch of scripts on which noone depends seems a bit silly&#8230;if a feature seems to be missing, get latest from master. If it&#8217;s still missing, send me a pull request (or log an issue). But I suppose it&#8217;s good to check in periodically to document what we&#8217;ve been up to.

New in this release:

  * Git 1.7.2 or better is required 
      * And I fixed a bug that prevented it from working with 1.7.10.
  * Prompt status now plays nicely with [posh-hg](https://github.com/JeremySkinner/posh-hg) without extra hacks
  * Functions are now provided for using `ssh-agent` to save credentials 
      * If you get a warning that `ssh-agent` could not be found, either add an `ssh-agent` PowerShell alias or [add the path to `Git\bin` in your `PATH` environment variable](http://blog.ryanrust.net/?p=67)
  * Branch in prompt status is now colored according to being ahead of or behind a tracked reference (see [readme](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git#readme "posh-git Readme") for an explanation of default colors)
  * Added tab expansion for a bunch of new commands and options (remote refs, `revert`, `tfs`, `bisect`, `submodule`, and more!)
  * Tab expansion works for aliases of `git` (I recommend `g`)

  * The list of commands expanded by default now covers most porcelain commands. 
      * You can always get all commands to expand by setting `$GitTabSettings.AllCommands = $true`
  * Values of `$LASTERRORCODE` for the last real command are preserved through the prompt
  * If prompt performance for a repository is not acceptable, that repo&#8217;s path can be added to `$GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus`

  * posh-git should work in the Nuget Package Manager Console, though you&#8217;ll probably want to [change the colors](http://sedodream.com/2012/05/05/GitCustomizingColorsForWindowsIncludingPoshgit.aspx "Git customizing colors for Windows including posh-git")
  * The `GIT_DIR` environment variable is used if defined

[Several others](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/graphs/contributors "posh-git Contributors") have contributed bug fixes as wellâ€”thanks everyone! It&#8217;s pretty awesome to work on something that someone else cares enough about to help improve.

If all goes according to plan, the next time you hear from me (about posh-git) will be to announce that migration to [LibGit2Sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) is complete. I&#8217;m optimistic that the move will address the persistent performance concerns for large repositories. If you have a particularly troublesome repo, feel free to try [my libgit2 branch](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/commits/libgit2) and let me know if it&#8217;s better (or worse).
