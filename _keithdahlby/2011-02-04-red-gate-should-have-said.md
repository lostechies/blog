Red Gate Software&#8217;s recent [open letter to the .NET community](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/announcement) has caused a bit of a stir. Here&#8217;s an alternate version that may have gone over better&#8230;

> In August 2008, Red Gate took over stewardship of [.NET Reflector](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/), one of the most popular .NET developer tools around. At the time, [we said](http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/opinion-pieces/the-future-of-reflector-/) we would &#8220;continue to offer the tool for free to the community,&#8221; and we&#8217;ve made good on that promise. Since then, we&#8217;ve invested heavily in .NET Reflector:
> 
>   * A Visual Studio plug-in, allowing you to jump direcetly to classes and methods in Reflector
>   * Support for .NET 4 assemblies
>   * Support for C# 4 and Visual Basic 10 language features
>   * Support for opening assemblies from the Global Assembly Cache
>   * Numerous bug fixes
> 
> Unfortunately, these investments have come at a higher cost than anticipated. As of version 7, due for release in March 2011, we will charge $35 for .NET Reflector. Version 6.7 will continue to be available for free&mdash;forever, but we hope you&#8217;ll find the [new features of version 7](http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/clivet/archive/2011/02/01/99118.aspx "New features in V7 of .NET Reflector.") to be worth the investment.

> We appreciate your continued trust in Red Gate to provide the best in tools for .NET developers.
