Earlier this month I had the opportunity to record an episode of [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/) with GitHubbers [Paul Betts](http://blog.paulbetts.org/) and [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/) on the state of Git for Windows: [Herding Code 132](http://herdingcode.com/?p=384 "Herding Code 132: Phil Haack, Keith Dahlby and Paul Betts on Git for Windows developers"). Topics included discussions on why Git hates developers and why Mercurial proponents&#8217; claim that Git doesn&#8217;t preserve history is &#8220;nonsense.&#8221; I think the show turned out pretty well, and we got some hints as to what we can expect from GitHub for Windows. Thanks to the Herding Code guys for having us on!

Speaking of [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git), there are a bunch of new goodies in my master branch including tab expansion for remote branches, support for the Nuget console, and easier integration with [posh-hg](https://github.com/JeremySkinner/posh-hg). I&#8217;ll post more details with the upcoming v0.4 release.
