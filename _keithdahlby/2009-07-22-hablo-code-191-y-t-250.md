First off, a big thanks to Chris Missal and the other Techies for a [warm welcome](/blogs/chrismissal/archive/2009/07/10/lostechies-welcomes-keith-dahlby.aspx " LosTechies welcomes Keith Dahlby"). I&#8217;ve been blogging solo for a little over a year now, mostly on various [SharePoint development](http://solutionizing.net/category/sharepoint/) topics with a few [PowerShell](http://solutionizing.net/category/powershell/) and [general .NET](http://solutionizing.net/category/net/) posts here and there, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to learning from this larger audience. As I said when I started, I make no claims of expertise. I simply enjoy sharing techniques and technicalities that I find interesting, and I hope you find them useful, or at least educational, too.

In no particular order, and without any promises, you can probably expect to hear from me about&#8230;

  * LINQ
  * F#
  * .NET 4.0 & VS 2010 
  * SharePoint 2007 and 2010
  * PowerShell v2
  * Silverlight 3
  * Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience topics

Finally, I&#8217;ll leave you with a few links to (what I think are) some of my more interesting posts, many of which I will likely refer back to from time to time.
