I&#8217;ve been meaning to put together a post about this for a few days, but [Mark Embling](http://www.markembling.info/) [beat me to it](http://www.markembling.info/view/git-powershell-revisited "Git & PowerShell Revisited").

I&#8217;m a big fan of PowerShell and Git, but had never bothered using them together until Jeremy Skinner&#8217;s [post about adding tab completion](http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/2010/03/07/using-git-with-windows-powershell/ "Using Git with Windows PowerShell") pushed me over the edge. [Mark&#8217;s post](http://www.markembling.info/view/git-powershell-revisited "Git & PowerShell Revisited") has more details, but the short version is that there&#8217;s a [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/posh-git/) and [GitHub repository](http://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git "posh-git on GitHub") that we will be using going forward in an effort to make Git and PowerShell work better together.

Over the coming weeks I&#8217;ll have more to say about what we&#8217;ve been up to, but if you&#8217;re at all interested in Git on PowerShell or have your own tips or tricks you&#8217;d like to share, please leave a comment or join the group.
