## Overview

Documentation and working samples are great. Trust me, we&#8217;re working on them. That being said, I can communicate much better when you&#8217;re right beside me and I can talk to you. You can fly out and spend the week with my team, or&#8230;you can attend a new installment of Webinars for FubuMVC.

## Content

This is a work in progress but here&#8217;s the plan so far (I&#8217;ll update this as I come up with more ideas):

#### F101 &#8211; Behaviors, Configuration, and Runtime

I&#8217;m going to drill our entire architecture into your head. I&#8217;ll explain this magic BehaviorGraph and Behavior idea that we always talk. By the end of this, you should understand what makes FubuMVC different.

#### F102 &#8211; View Engines and Html Conventions

I&#8217;ll discuss the View Engines that we currently support, how to get them up and running, basic usage scenarios, and we&#8217;ll dive into Html Conventions.

#### F103 &#8211; Custom Behaviors

I&#8217;ll discuss usages for behaviors and how to write/apply your own.

## Schedule

I&#8217;m flexible on this but I&#8217;m looking to schedule the first Webinar (F101) for this Friday at 10:00AM CST. Of course, these will be recorded and I will post them as soon as I can.

I&#8217;m at your disposal for these and I&#8217;m doing it for you. So, what do you think? I&#8217;m not going to budge much on the content for F101 but I&#8217;m willing to expand it and schedule it so that it makes sense.

Discuss!
