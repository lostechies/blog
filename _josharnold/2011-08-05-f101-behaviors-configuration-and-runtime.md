> **Update:**
  
> I have redone this webinar with some &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; and I think everyone will agree that the second pass was much more successful. I&#8217;ll leave this one up here for you to make fun of me but I strongly recommend that you watch the better one: <http://lostechies.com/josharnold/2011/08/19/f101-%E2%80%93-behaviors-configuration-and-runtime-2/>

Thanks to everyone who attended this morning&#8217;s webinar. Here are the slides and the first stab at the recording.

Looks like Vimeo cut down the quality quite a bit. I&#8217;m going to re-upload again in HD and see how it handles that. In the meantime, though, you can follow along with the slides.
