At the advice of [Sam Merrell](http://twitter.com/smerrell), I recently read the Art of Community. It&#8217;s nothing groundbreaking nor does it contain anything truly profounding; however, it got my brain going in a direction that it hadn&#8217;t before. It gave me a burst of energy that I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. And that? That&#8217;s enough of a reason for me to recommend it to anyone.

### Home

About a week and a half ago now, the [Fubu family of projects got a new home](http://fubu-project.org). It&#8217;s a work in progress, but I like to think that it marks a commitment to just how serious we&#8217;re becoming about our stack. We&#8217;ve been around for a while and now it&#8217;s time to brighten things up a bit and show off what we can do.

It was no coincidence that we launched our new home when we did. We&#8217;ve picked up several new [contributors](http://mvc.fubu-project.org/#contributors), our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/fubumvc-devel) is blowing up, and the interest in our projects is higher than we&#8217;ve ever seen it.

> We have momentum and we aim to leverage it.

### Community

I mentioned that our activity is increasing. [Jeremy](http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller) and I have been working hard through various infrastructure pieces, [Alex](http://twitter.com/ahjohannessen) is constantly holding us accountable for Mono support, [Sam](http://twitter.com/smerrell) is cranking out the docs, and the community is beginning to sustain itself.

I&#8217;ve never been as actively involved in any other communities as I am with Fubu &#8212; especially not as part of their leadership. The comradery is just phenomenal. I&#8217;m supposed to be on leave from all things technical with the [birth of my first son](http://twitpic.com/6doxky), but I can&#8217;t help but sneak in a few minutes here and there. Of course, the warm wishes and congratulations from this group of people have been greatly appreciated.

### Where we do we from here

Well, there&#8217;s a few things that need to happen.

  1. Fix our [NuGet issues](http://groups.google.com/group/fubumvc-devel/browse_thread/thread/b83070e42de43e52) (Jeremy&#8217;s working on this and I keep publicly poking at him &#8212; which I know he just loves)
  2. Docs (currently in progress via the lovely Sam Merrell)
  3. Get the word out ([Mike Murray](http://twitter.com/mkmurray) and I do webinars whenever we can fit them in and one day we&#8217;ll do one together &#8212; if he likes me enough)
  4. Keep up the pace (with the help of the great [Rex Morgan](http://rexflex.net), we&#8217;re keeping our new fancy sites up to date and aggregating info like crazy)

What am I missing? What are you, as a Fubu user, having pain points with and what can we do to help?
