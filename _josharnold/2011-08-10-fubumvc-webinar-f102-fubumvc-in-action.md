As I mentioned before, I&#8217;m currently hosting weekly webinars on Fridays at 10:00am CST. This week will be the second installment of these webinars and will focus on seeing and using FubuMVC in Action.

I&#8217;ve asked the attendees of the previous webinar to contribute some ideas on what to build, but I welcome any and all suggestions.

Here&#8217;s a brief overview of what we&#8217;ll cover:

  * View Engines and HTML Conventions
  * Validation
  * Custom Behaviors
  * Bootstrapping
  * Partials
