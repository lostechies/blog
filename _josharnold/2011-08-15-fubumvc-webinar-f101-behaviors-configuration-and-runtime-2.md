This week we will be re-doing the first episode with some lessons learned incorporated into the slides. Just to recap the overview of this installment&#8230;

> I’m going to drill our entire architecture into your head. I’ll explain this magic BehaviorGraph and Behavior idea that we always talk about. By the end of this, you should understand what makes FubuMVC different.

This is a conceptual talk but we will dive into some basic FubuMVC coding and get a project off the ground and running in your browser.

Join us this Friday (8/19) at 10:00AM CST:
