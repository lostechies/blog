In my previous post, I introduced FubuMVC.Validation and the power of the &#8220;drop in Bottles&#8221; found in FubuMVC. Today, I&#8217;m happy to continue that series by introducing FubuMVC.AutoComplete.



This is a simplistic demonstration but I want to make note of two things:

  1. I didn&#8217;t have to change any of my markup or write any javascript
  2. I didn&#8217;t have to write an endpoint to serve up the JSON data for the jquery plugin
