As some of you may already know, [FubuMVC finally hit 1.0](http://jeremydmiller.com/2013/01/11/fubumvc-turns-1-0/). In response to this milestone, Jeremy and I are hard at work on docs and trying to restrain the urge to write new features until those are done.

Today I&#8217;m happy to announce the first installment of screencasts is ready to share with the world. Validation isn&#8217;t the most exciting thing to talk about but watch carefully. This illustrates some of the killer features of FubuMVC that you&#8217;re going to want to pay attention to in the coming weeks.
