Thanks to everyone who attended this morning&#8217;s webinar. The code and slides from today&#8217;s session can be found at: <https://github.com/jmarnold/F101>

Today we focused on learning the basics of FubuMVC while touching on the following topics:

  * From routes to methods
  * What&#8217;s a Controller Action?
  * ActionCalls
  * Behaviors
  * Behavior: Nodes, Chains, and Graph
  * From methods routes: IUrlPolicy
  * Behavior Invocation

I will continue with these webinars to provide newcomers to the framework with an entry point. The only thing that I ask is that you [provide feedback in our mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/fubumvc-devel) for two things:

  * How to improve these webinars
  * How to incorporate the content of these webinars into our guides

If you&#8217;re feeling particularly generous, please talk to me if you&#8217;re interested in helping us with our guides.

Last but not least, here is today&#8217;s recording:
