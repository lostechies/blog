You know how when you haven&#8217;t blogged in a long time, you completely lose perspective on just HOW LONG it&#8217;s actually been? I pulled up my posts to check a while ago and realized it had been TWO YEARS since I last updated. I think it&#8217;s time to break radio silence.

_Warning: this is a reflective post more than it is a technical post.Â _

**Where I&#8217;ve been**
  
I went heads down after my last post vigorously working on the Fubu ecosystem. At the close of 2013, I embarked on a new journey. I took a break from essentially ALL open source contributions, blogging, and twitter. I rejoined the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; .NET world for a while and did a lot more work in various other platforms (NodeJS primarily). I worked on several SPAs and gained a much different perspective on everything else I had been missing.

I spent a lot of time last year rethinking old habits and philosophies on testing; most of them held up. I also spent a lot of time doing things much differently than I prefer to do them. I have a newfound appreciation and passion for testing that I think I had lost at some point.

**Back in the saddle**
  
A few months ago, I rejoined the team at Dovetail. I&#8217;ve been quietly catching up on the latest work within the Fubu ecosystem, meeting with Jeremy about his latest masterpiece(s), and finding my fit again. I&#8217;m sure blogging is part of that. I also fully plan to become active within the OSS community once more. I don&#8217;t know what that looks like exactly yet but I will be part of the next Fubu release to some capacity.

_Note: We did just have a new baby so my availability is limited_

TL;DR: I&#8217;m still alive and will be much more vocal soon.
