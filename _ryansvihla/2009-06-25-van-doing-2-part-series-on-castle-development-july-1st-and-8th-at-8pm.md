I know this isn&#8217;t related to my Pylons series and worry not there is no interruption in that, but I&#8217;m giving a couple of talks on <a target="_blank" title="Virtual Alt.net" href="/controlpanel/blogs/posteditor.aspx/www.virtualaltnet.com">Virtual Alt.Net</a><span style="border-collapse: collapse">. The first one I&#8217;ve done before and you may have heard it at Alamo Coders, the second one is all new and it&#8217;ll give me opportunity to clean up and release my lightweight plugin framework for monorail.</span>

For those of you who don&#8217;t know Virtual Alt Net is held over Live Meeting <a target="_self" title="here" href="http://www.snipr.com/virtualaltnet">here</a>

<span style="border-collapse: collapse">Part 1 July 1st: IoC and Dip through Castle Windsor:</p> 

<p>
  Description: Ever<br /> wonder what acronyms like IoC and Dip mean? If you know what they mean<br /> do you wonder why anyone would use them in code?&nbsp; This talk aims to<br /> deal primarily with those two questions through the use of Castle<br /> Windsor IoC container.&nbsp; Intermediate level C# material with a couple of<br /> more advanced demos at the end for fun and pleasure.</span>
</p>

<p>
  Part 2 July 8th: Web Development with Castle Monorail, Active Record and Brail view engine
</p>

<p>
  Description: Have a look at the first popular MVC&nbsp; .Net based web framework. Also will be covering persistence with ActiveRecord, and view templates using Brail.&nbsp; Bonus, will demo a plugin framework for building CMS-like applications.
