With today&#8217;s world of programming languages where many languages are better at certain tasks than other&#8217;s you&#8217;ll find it useful to learn multiple languages over the course of your career (as well as keeping your skill sets current).

Here are some tips I&#8217;ve had to learn the hard way:

### Step 1: Your second language should be similar to your first

Your brain will confuse a lot of language decisions with computational necessities. Warts from your first language will show more, and syntax will make your head explode.

### Step 2: Compare and contrast common task based libraries to get a gist of the differences.

Namely, ORMs, Web Frameworks, Unit testing libraries, Xml reading/writing, Csv reading/writing, Http/REST clients, templating languages, email sending, and I&#8217;m sure a few more I&#8217;m forgetting. Doing this will not only teach you language specific idioms quickly, it&#8217;ll also give your brain a chance to see the similarities and what bits of data are really necessary to do task X or Y.

### Step 3: Get involved with the community

Get on mailing lists or better still go to user groups in your area. See what the programmers in that community are obsessed with (I&#8217;m looking at you Python and your giant PEP 8 discussion about style), ask foolish questions. Learning a language is a lot about fitting into a community. You may be the determined to bring some concepts from your mother language in, but first learn how to treat your new language as a second mother first.

### Step 4: Write several simplistic projects that replace the common big frameworks.

This is an extension of the last couple steps. Â Write a unit test library, an ORM, a web framework, rest library, etc, make them simple enough to just work barely, but focus on what you think is a good client API heavily. They will suck, have someone who&#8217;s good at that language tell you why it sucks.

### Step 5: Learn a third language and a fourth, fifth&#8230;

The third should be totally earth shatteringly different and ideally solve some task for you that is hard otherwise in your other languages (this is a great time to learn functional programming). You&#8217;ll learn a lot more about programming in general this way. Repeat steps 2 through 4.
