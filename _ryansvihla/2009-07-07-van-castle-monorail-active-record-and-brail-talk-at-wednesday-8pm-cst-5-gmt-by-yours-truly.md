Last week I did a talk on Windsor and it went..ok. I’m not used to online presentations and am more experienced in front of crowds that I can interact with.

So between last week’s experience and some advice from <a href="https://lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/" target="_blank">Agile Joe</a> this talk I’ll be aiming for more of a screen cast feel.&#160; The talk should go for close to an hour and will be open for questions afterword.

Outline is as follows (subject to change):

  * Monorail
  * Controllers
  * Windsor integration
  * Grouping controllers (“Area’s”)
  * Aspect Oriented Programming through Filters

  * Brail View Engine
  * Conditionals and Iterators
  * Parent/Child Views
  * Sub Views
  * Rescues

  * Active Record
  * Architecture overview
  * Using multiple databases
  * Using Active Record in a more DDD friendly way
  * Introduction to writing queries in HQL
  * Working with the underlying ISession.

If any of you have the time drop by for some/all of this and give me some feedback please do so.
