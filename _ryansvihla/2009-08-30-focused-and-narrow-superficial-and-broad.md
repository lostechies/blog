In my 20&#8217;s I got exposed to a large variety of work situations and was able to succeed in a variety of technical fields (admin, developer, hardware tech, etc). I had the time back then to not have to choose which direction I went with things, I went broad but deep into each field I was interested in. Every couple of years I&#8217;d go head long into another field and read dozen books, setup labs experiment like crazy, use whatever connections I&#8217;d made to get my foot in the door somewhere and then make sure I delivered in big ways, and most importantly keep reviewing what I&#8217;d done in the past to make sure it actually did work and did work well.

This obsessive learning habit had a great side effect, as long as I stuck to slightly related fields I learned exponentially more. Learning about networking made helping customers with a variety of issues far easier when I was just a lowly computer tech.&nbsp; When I was trying to automate customer installations in a repeatable way, learning software development even at a trivial level made things possible that were not otherwise.&nbsp; I got to see how everythign interconnected.

Nowadays though I have a busy life, I no longer can work 80+ hours a week year round, while studying, practicing or experimenting with the rest of my time. I now have to choose which way to do I go. I think I&#8217;m mostly going &#8220;Focused and Narrow&#8221; on a few subfields that are closely related to one another. I will focus for the near future on systems development and virtualization, I&#8217;ll still probably be a language addict and wanting to do it a number of different ways, but I think for awhile I need to consildate my limited time and energy. I hope I don&#8217;t lose my larger view and perspective on things, but I doubt I can any longer keep up with new versions of Postfix, Exchange, or Qmail, motherboard slot types, RAM, or whatever things that I used to know in much greater detail than I do now.
