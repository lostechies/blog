My name is Eric Anderson, and I am NOT the newest member of LosTechies.&nbsp; I am, however, the most recent person to make an introductory post. I landed my first development job in 1997 and stayed with that company through my graduation from Texas A&M University in 2000.&nbsp; I took a break from software to pursue other interests from 2001 to 2006.&nbsp; One of the first people that I met when returning to the industry in 2006 was fellow LosTechie Jimmy Bogard.&nbsp; Since that time, I have come to appreciate Agile development practices and love to share the Agile love with those around me.

I am honored to have been invited into the LosTechies fold, and I look forward to getting back to blogging and contributing to the software community at large.
