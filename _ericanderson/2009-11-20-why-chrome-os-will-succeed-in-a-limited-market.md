Randall Kennedy released an excellent analysis of the Chrome OS that I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9141207/Why_Chrome_OS_will_fail_big_time?taxonomyId=0&pageNumber=2">invite you to read</a>.&nbsp; In that analysis, Mr. Kennedy outlines why he believes that the Chome OS is doomed to fail miserably.&nbsp; Though I haven&#8217;t seen Chrome OS myself, I believe his read on the operating system is solid.&nbsp; This is a stripped down operating system that basically locks the user into web applications with the Chrome browser as the interface.&nbsp; The operating system is at its core a paired down version of linux and does not seem to support running desktop applications.&nbsp; Because this is a this OS that only supports the web browser, Mr. Kennedy&#8217;s analysis is that no user will want this running on their computer.&nbsp; This is where Kennedy misses the point.

From reports including Mr. Kennedy&#8217;s article, Google will be releasing Chrome OS on a limited set of hardware.&nbsp; Instead of having to deal with device drivers for a wide array of display adapters and whatnot, it appears that Google will be shipping Chrome OS on a constrained set of netbooks.&nbsp; Kennedy looks at this limited set of hardware combined with the limited features of Chrome OS and determines that with all these restrictions, nobody will use the operating system.&nbsp; This is where Kennedy has missed the point.

Personally, I would be happy to have a netbook running Chrome OS on it.&nbsp; With access to Google apps, I will still have simple spreadsheets and word processing inside of the full functional web browser.&nbsp; I would use a Chrome OS netbook like, well, a netbook.&nbsp; I would surf the web and check email.&nbsp; My wife and I would keep it in the kitchen for looking up recipes on our favorite recipe sites.&nbsp; My wife would use it to waste time on Facebook, er&#8230; &#8220;see what her friends are up to.&#8221;&nbsp; I would have to find a web Twitter client that I like since I&#8217;m guessing I wouldn&#8217;t be able to run TweetDeck.&nbsp; But, that&#8217;s not a major loss.

I don&#8217;t want to run VisualStudio on my netbook.&nbsp; I probably wouldn&#8217;t care if I couldn&#8217;t run Word.&nbsp; As long as the user is looking for a simple web appliance that is better than a mobile phone while being lighter and less expensive than an entry laptop, then I think a Chrome OS netbook could be a suitable device.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, this is a narrow market.&nbsp; No, Google won&#8217;t be making a big dent in Windows (or Mac for that matter) with this device.&nbsp; However, this could get them a decent footing in a tough market to make headway into.

I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords
