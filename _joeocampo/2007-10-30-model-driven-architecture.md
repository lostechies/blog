I was really excited to read about Microsoft&#8217;s recent exploration into the <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2007/10/30/oslo-mda-soa.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage" target="_blank">MDA arena!</a>&nbsp; This is something I have been wanting for quite sometime but I am very hesitant to get too excited.&nbsp; Microsoft has a tendency to create bloat ware and this may kill the tool from being adopted (Think Rational Rose).

&nbsp;

I can definitely speak from experience on this subject that it does definitely bridge the gap between all stakeholders.&nbsp; The key is to not look at MDA like failed attempts of the past that have attempted to capture the architecture in a model.&nbsp; The reason these attempts failed is because they took a Waterfall approach to creating software, where the model was the technical spec on which the development team was expected to produce software.&nbsp; This model proved to be like all specification documents, useless, by the time the development team actually coded the system.&nbsp; For one, the models where created by analyst who had no clue about software engineering!&nbsp; They believed that if it looked good on paper then it must work this way in the code.

Utilizing a Model driven approach to creating software in an Agile environment forms a synergistic bond between&nbsp; stakeholders.&nbsp; Story cards are great but models speak volumes to elucidating greater concepts about the domain that may have been overlooked otherwise.&nbsp; In an Agile environment the models are never complete.&nbsp; 

  * They evolve with the software as you move from iteration to iteration.&nbsp; 
  * They are not a contract but a mere representation of thoughts and ideas to a domain solution.&nbsp; 
  * Modeling sessions participants are facilitated by a modeler who has very good soft skills in communicating the architecture as it relates to the domain (Always a developer)!&nbsp; 
  * The Product owners take an active role, in that they drive the session at is relates to the business domain.&nbsp; 
  * The Testers use the model the gain an understanding on testing strategies they will use to validate the domain against the code.&nbsp; 

From a modeling session you can easily decompose a business domain into manageable stories and you have a working reference from where the stories originated from if you need to come up with a strategy on how the implement the story.

I have been thinking of an idea for pursuing yet another OSS tool around modeling and this just kick starts that even more.&nbsp; More to come on that later.
