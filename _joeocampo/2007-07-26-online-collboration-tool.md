I stumbled across this interesting tool called <a href="http://thinkature.com/" target="_blank">Thinkature</a> for collaborating online.&nbsp; Seems to&nbsp;very&nbsp;promising however the UI seems to be&nbsp;unresponsive at times.&nbsp; Interesting concept&nbsp;since you should be able to brain storm with colleagues on a project and persist the workspace for later viewing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Does anyone have any other similar tools they utilize for collaborating with others on the web?
