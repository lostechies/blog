I hate to get touchy feely but I think what I am about to say holds the most weight when presented in this manner. 

If we look at our code as a living and breathing life form, we are responsible for its creation and well being.&nbsp; As we hack through our code feverishly because of dead lines or time constraints we severely retard the health of our code.&nbsp; Why do we allow this to happen?&nbsp; Usually this is because we don’t have anything to monitor the cholesterol or blood sugar level of the code.&nbsp; There is no external indicators that allow us to gauge the health of the code. 

Take for instance when I was in high school I use to love to play sports, any sport.&nbsp; If it had a ball in it, I was there.&nbsp; My mother told me to watch what I ate, make sure to eat lots of vegetables , exercise, etc.&nbsp; Did I listen???? No!&nbsp; I ate what ever I wanted and didn’t give it any thought because there wasn’t any immediate external visible signs of what was happening to me internally. I could leap, run and jump with the same intensity as I did when I was a child so why should I change? 

Now fast forward 20 years.&nbsp; Well, I still love to play sports but I can’t play them&nbsp; near the same intensity I had as a teenager.&nbsp; My body hurts in places I never even knew could hurt. Jumping down off the kitchen counter causes my knees to buckle under the pressure of descending 3 feet! What I didn’t know is that I was incurring a health debt early on in my child hood that is having horrible compounding effects in my middle age. 

The same deteriorating effects happen with software, just at a much more rapid pace.&nbsp; This deterioration&nbsp; happens in front of our noses, we just don’t pay it any attention because there isn’t any external indication of the impact to health of our software. Or is there? 

  * Can you change your code and understand the side effect or worse are you afraid to change your code at all? 
  * Can you \*easily\* change your code or do you spend sleepless nights adding the simplest of changes to your code? 
  * Do you know how much of your code is tightly coupled? 
  * Do you think that orthogonal principles are something that is only for enterprise projects? 
  * When you run a code coverage tool do you throw the results away because there is so much red and not enough time? 
  * Are you prioritizing defects as Critical, Important, High, Medium and Low; where Important and High account for 80% of the defects but are not taken care of because they are not in a critical state? 
  * Do you follow ANY type of SDLC? 
  * Do you attempt to include your customer or at least have a customer proxy to advocate concern and prioritize your work? 
  * Is your code littered with comments such as, “we need to fix this”, “Don’t change this because I don’t know how I fixed this?”, “WTF?” 

Now the magnitude of how much each one of these questions effects technical debt is purely subjective.&nbsp; The point I am trying to make is that your code is not in a healthy state and has the possibility of contracting a terminal illness that will lead to its death if you don’t take care of it now!
