Yesterday Sean and I talked briefly about [Convention over Configuration](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/sean_chambers/archive/2007/12/08/phil-haack-posts-about-asp-net-mvc.aspx) and how disappointed we both were on MS direction requiring the [ControllerAction] attribute for each action in the controller.&nbsp; Similar sentiments seen in [Ayende&#8217;s post](http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/12/08/Configuration-over-Convention.aspx) as well.&nbsp; 

Less than a day later [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/) responds with a &#8220;[ConventionController&#8221;.](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/09/extending-asp.net-mvc-to-add-conventions.aspx)&nbsp; This controller gives the convention approach to the ASPMVC framework similar to MR.&nbsp; I figured it shouldn&#8217;t be that difficult for MS to implement this approach and Phil expeditiously verified that.&nbsp; 

Hat&#8217;s off to Phil for getting this turned around so quickly and listening to the community.
