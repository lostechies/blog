This is more of a question that anything else.

I have allot of documentation on our Agile Process and I have to publish it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently it is in a&nbsp;Word Document format but I don&#8217;t&nbsp;like the&nbsp;constraints of having to version a document.&nbsp; I love the idea of&nbsp;moving it to a WIKI for the collaboration and integrated versioning.&nbsp; But, I have to still be able to hand over a document to a&nbsp;regulatory oversight committees at any given time.&nbsp; So my question is:

Is there a WIKI engine that has a way of publishing the&nbsp;content to a doc, pdf or RTF&nbsp;format?

Sounds like a simple request but am having a hard time consulting the great Google oracle for the answer.
