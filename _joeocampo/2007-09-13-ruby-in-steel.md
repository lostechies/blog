I want to get a little more serious about Ruby.&nbsp; I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with [Ruby in Steel](http://sapphiresteel.com/).&nbsp; It seems like the most logical choice for .Net developers at this time.&nbsp; What other tools should a Windows developer use to have somewhat of the same development IDE experience of Visual Studio?
