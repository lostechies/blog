Well maybe at least for consultants that is.

&nbsp;

I am going to state something that is obvious to me but maybe I am just being naive.

&nbsp;

I think that Scrum creates 3 different types of job roles:

  1. **Scrum Master**: This person is basically a project manager and leader over the process and the project. 
      * **Scrum Lord**:&nbsp;This is a new term that we came up with during my Scrum Master training a year ago, A Scrum Lord is basically the person in charge of coaching the development group on TDD, Continuous Integration and Pair Programming. 
          * **Scrum Duke/Duchess**: This is a term I just came up with for the person responsible for teaching Automated Acceptance testing to a quality group.</ol> 
        &nbsp;
        
        Depending on the size of the project and the size of the group one person could wear all these hats.&nbsp; In an enterprise you could easily see many people wearing these hats.&nbsp; I want to remind everyone that these roles are Leadership and Coaching roles not dictatorships!
        
        &nbsp;
        
        I just thought of another term,&nbsp; what about the people doing the work?&nbsp; I dub these people: **Scrum peasants**.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think that will go over that well? LOL
        
        &nbsp;
        
        And if you are practicing distributed agile the HSMIC is called the: **Scrum Emperor**.&nbsp; Nice monarchy terms.&nbsp; What would be funny/scary is if these terms caught on!
        
        &nbsp;
        
        So I don&#8217;t forget, these are the actual Scrum roles or idioms:
        
        **Scrum Master:** The person, persons in charge of the tracking and the daily updates for the scrum (Equivalent to a Project Manager) 
        
        **Pigs:** Those who are committed to the tasks (Developers, B.A&#8217;s, Dba&#8217;s and tester)  
        **Chickens:** Those who are involved but do not have tasks. (Project Owners etc&#8230;)  
        **Back log:** The task to be completed  
        **Sprint:** A 4 to 6 week period in which a set of tasks are committed to and which are finished  
        **Burn Down:** Daily progress for a sprint over the sprints length.
