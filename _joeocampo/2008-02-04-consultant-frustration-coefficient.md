Talking to <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joeydotnet/default.aspx" target="_blank">Joey B</a> this evening about creating a tool that would measure how frustrated you may become with wanting to mentor a team on Agile development practices. I am calling this the Consultant Frustration Coefficient. 

What you would do is hand out a short questionnaire that would ask varying questions to assess the clientâ€™s value system and the staffâ€™s literacy level as it relates to development pragmatic practices. 

The result would look something like this: 

  * **Code**: Staff shows a firm understanding of claiming to know OOP however certain frequencies indicate that staff view OOP as COBOL syntax with many function libs. <font color="#ff0000">Caution should be taken.</font>
  * **Design Patterns:** Staff shows understanding of design patterns relating to UML documentation. All indicators are pointing towards an automated code creation and wizard driven setup culture. <font color="#ff0000">Caution should be taken.</font>
  * **TDD:** Staff understands what Unit Testing is but does not understand why they should write test that QA should be writing. They do not want to use open source libraries. <font color="#ff0000">Critical deal breaker here! Extreme Caution!</font>
  * **Paired Programming:** Staff indicators show extreme frustration with one another and would rather work alone in their cubicles on development task. <font color="#ff0000">Caution should be taken.</font>
  * **CI:** Management indicators show reluctance to increased time spent outside of coding and server setup. Good luck getting it passed management. Staff may show resistance. <font color="#ff0000">Caution should be taken.</font>
  * **Agile:** Staff has the probability of buying into it but management value system does not lend itself to embracing agile. <font color="#ff0000">Caution, you may be wasting your time.</font>

<font color="#ff0000"><strong>CFC Rating: This project will pose extreme challenges and frustration for you. But it looks like all of your other opportunities right now so go with it!</strong></font> 

Any other categories that we should collect? ðŸ™‚
