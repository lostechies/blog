# Pablo&#8217;s Fiesta

Wanted to take this time to say thank you to everyone that attended Pablo&#8217;s Fiesta. &nbsp;This community surprises me every year with the amount of content and dialog that is discussed by so many passionate professionals. &nbsp;Without each of you, the LosTechies community would not be possible.

If you weren&#8217;t able to make it to this years Fiesta, shame on you! No seriously, all is not lost. A lot of the conveners where able to capture notes about the topics they discussed. &nbsp;To find out more please visit the following wiki:

We left with a ton of dialog to be hacked on and vetted. Needless to say this is not the last Pablo&#8217;s Fiesta. &nbsp;Planning will start soon on the next years event. If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to voice some improvements around the event, please feel free to leave me a comment. We are all about open honest feedback.

Again thank you to everyone and I look forward to seeing you at next years event!

&nbsp;

Sincerely,

Joe Ocampo
