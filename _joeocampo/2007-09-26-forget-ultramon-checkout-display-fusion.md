I am a huge fan of multiple monitors.&nbsp; I currently have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SyncMaster-245BW-LCD-Monitor/dp/B000P6MOG2" target="_blank">24&#8243; windscreen LCD</a> surrounded by <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19&sku=320-5579" target="_blank">two 19&#8243; LCDs</a>.&nbsp; To me this is development nirvana but it order to truly be productive you need software to help you manage so much screen real estate.&nbsp; In the past I have used <a href="http://realtimesoft.com/ultramon/" target="_blank">UltraMon</a>.&nbsp; This was great when I was running Windows XP but when I migrated to Vista <a href="http://realtimesoft.com/ultramon/" target="_blank">UltraMon&#8217;s</a> usefulness was crippled by Aero.&nbsp; That is until I ran across <a href="http://www.binaryfortress.com/displayfusion/" target="_blank">Display Fusion</a>.

<a href="http://www.binaryfortress.com/displayfusion/" target="_blank">Display Fusion</a> is an awesome multi monitor utility.&nbsp; It has a small footprint and best of all it is written in .Net 2.0.&nbsp; I love that it doesn&#8217;t depend on buttons being added to the title bar but key board shortcuts that utilize the lonely windows key.

It does allot more but I will let the site speak to that.&nbsp; Go ahead a check it out.
