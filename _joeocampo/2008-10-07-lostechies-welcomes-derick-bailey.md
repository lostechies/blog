We would like to welcome [Derick Bailey](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/derick_bailey/) to the LosTechies blogging community! 

Some of us had the opportunity to meet Derick at [Pablo&#8217;s Day of TDD](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/09/15/announcing-pablo-s-days-of-tdd-in-austin-tx.aspx) and were impressed with his passion and commitment to modern&nbsp; day software development. He is able to take low level constructs and communicate at a high enough level to where ideas that appeared to be esoteric suddenly make sense. 

We are pleased to have him on board and know his passion will help other developers to find answers to questions or figure out new technologies as all the LosTechies bloggers strive to do. 

Welcome Derick!
