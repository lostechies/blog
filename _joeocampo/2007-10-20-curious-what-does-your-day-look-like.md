I am just curious about all these great post I see coming from many of you.&nbsp; How do you all (Texans ya&#8217;ll) find the time?

My typical day.

  * 5:30 Wake-up kids, and family
  * Snooze till 6:15 (I need all the beauty rest I can get!)&nbsp; 
  * 7:15 Take kids to school
  * 7:30 Drop off kids
  * 8 &#8211; 8:15 Get to Work
  * 8:30-6:30PM I am at work (some where in there I manage to eat lunch)
  * 6:30 &#8211; 8:00 (I am at my daughters cheerleading, Sons chess club or what ever else he is doing)
  * 7:00 &#8211; 8:00 Eat dinner with family if time permits and talk about their day.
  * 8:00 &#8211; 9:30 spend time with the family
  * 9:30 put kids to bed
  * 9:30 &#8211; 10:30 Spend time with Wife.&nbsp; (Yeah, one whole hour LOL) 
  * 10:30 &#8211; 2-3 AM Code and catch up on blogging.&nbsp; (If wife permits) ðŸ™‚

I am curious for those with commitments outside of work how does one find time.&nbsp; I myself some how manage to squeak in 10 minutes here and there on a post but I am curious how the rest of you all pull it off.
