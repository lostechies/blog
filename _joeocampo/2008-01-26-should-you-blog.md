Jeremy Miller has a great post on <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2008/01/25/should-i-blog.aspx" target="_blank">should you blog</a>.

I agree completely with Jeremy in that as a professional software developer you should blog regardless of your experience.&nbsp; Jeremy points out a lot of good points and bad so I am not going to reiterate what he said but what I will add is this.

If you are a senior developer or you want to become a senior developer/lead someday, it is imperative that you have a blog. Why?&nbsp; 

Our development culture changes at a rapid pace.&nbsp; Because of these rapid change it requires that the seasoned professional be able to adequately convey this information to others in a written and in verbal communication mediums.&nbsp; Blogs are a first place medium to covey this thought process in a written format.&nbsp; As a senior developer/lead, your knowledge will have to be imparted to others of team.&nbsp; I understand that the most effective scenario for this impartation is actually coding with the team.&nbsp; But this assumes you are already there.&nbsp; How about if you are applying for a job and your employer really wants to understand just who you are as a developer.&nbsp; I hate to say this but if you have a blog and have the skill set to match, you have a better chance at getting the job then others.&nbsp; Do all shops have this thought process? Probably not but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this becomes a standard weeding interview question in the future for senior developers.

Blogs help you remember.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I have a thought about something related to Agile and remember, &#8220;hey I posted about that.&#8221;&nbsp; Blogs allow you to instantly recall thoughts and ideas about a particular subject and refine what you may have written or completely dismiss what you thought at the time.

Humility people!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t be afraid to be wrong about what you think.&nbsp; It is ok to be wrong.&nbsp; I am going to say this again.&nbsp; It is ok to be wrong.&nbsp; You are going to be wrong and it&#8217;s ok.&nbsp; The fact is, you placed your thoughts out there to share with the world.&nbsp; If everyone agreed on everything everyone said we would have peace and joy in the world.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t remove the human element from the world, so just understand someone some where will **ALWAYS** disagree with your thoughts.&nbsp; But remember you aren&#8217;t blogging to make the world&nbsp; a better place.&nbsp; You are blogging first and foremost to simply convey **your** thoughts and opinions.&nbsp; If the world becomes a better place because of it, well consider yourself blessed.&nbsp;
