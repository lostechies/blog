In an effort to raise money for our hosting and overall maintenance of Los Techies, we have opened up a <a href="https://www.cafepress.com/lostechies" target="_blank">CafePress</a> store featuring our very own &#8220;Pablo&#8221;! 

So don&#8217;t be the only one on your team not sporting the latest tech fashion, head on over to <a href="https://www.cafepress.com/lostechies" target="_blank">CafePress</a> and get Pablo&#8217;d out! 

&nbsp;

You can also support our local&nbsp;San Antonio developers group &nbsp;<a href="http://www.alamocoders.net/" target="_blank">AlamoCoders</a> by visiting their store <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/alamocoders" target="_blank">here</a>.
