<a href="http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jimmy Bogard</a> has an excellent <a href="http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/2007/09/authoring-stories-with-nbehave-03.html" target="_blank">post</a> show casing some of the new features of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/NBehave/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=6849" target="_blank">NBehave 0.3</a>.

Some of the new features include:

  * Pending scenarios 
      * Console runner 
          * Decorate your tests with &#8220;Theme&#8221; and &#8220;Story&#8221; attributes 
              * Scenario result totals 
                  * Dry run output</ul> </ul> </ul> 
            I could go on but Jimmy does a much better job at explaining the usage of NBehave.
            
            As with any open source project we are always looking for contributors to add to the functionality of NBehave.&nbsp; Some of the features that are on the horizon are:
            
              * Integration with testing/specification frameworks 
                
                  * The story for authoring the &#8220;Then&#8221; part of the scenario still isn&#8217;t that great
                  * Features targeted for automated builds/CI 
                      * XML output 
                          * A nice XSLT formatter for XML output 
                              * HTML output of stories in addition to raw text 
                                  * Integration with CC.NET</ul> 
                                  * Setup/Teardown for stories/themes, with appropriate BDD names 
                                      * Not sure, since having everything encapsulated in the story can direct my API better</ul> </ul> 
                                Ordo Ab Chao!
