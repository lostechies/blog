And say hello <a href="http://www.google.com/goog411/" target="_blank">Goog 411</a>

My brother made me aware of a new free business information service provide by Google.&nbsp;

I actually used this over that last couple of days shopping for my kids and having to hunt down the elusive Pink Nintendo DS.&nbsp; Pretty convenient especially if you are driving.

One humorous tid bit is the polling sound seems to be someone muttering (boodoop, boodoop, boodoop, boodoop, boodoop, boodoop, boodoop)&nbsp; Pretty hilarious when you first hear it, then it starts to get annoying.
