Jimmy hasn&#8217;t been sleeping lately and has really put allot into the latest trunk of Behave#.&nbsp; His <a href="http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/2007/08/authoring-stories-with-bdd-using-behave.html" target="_blank">latest post</a> shows you how to combine Behave# with <a href="http://nspec.tigris.org/" target="_blank">NSpec</a> syntax to create very fluent, readable code.

He also answers one of the most common questions we get asked, &#8220;When to use Behave# and when to use, well other existing testing frameworks&#8221;.

Also in the works is combining the <a href="http://nbehave.org/" target="_blank">NBehave</a> project&nbsp;with Behave#!&nbsp; More to come on that later.

Happy coding!
