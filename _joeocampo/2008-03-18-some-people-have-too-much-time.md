So I gave my two weeks at my current employer around a week ago.&nbsp; So I really wasn&#8217;t expecting practical jokes until maybe the end of this week.&nbsp; Well lets just say my team got creative and managed to wrap my entire cube in foil paper in less then 30 minutes while I was in a meeting today.&nbsp; Very impressive!

There attention to detail was astonishing.&nbsp; They managed to wrap everything from the dry erase markers to every book on my shelf.&nbsp; They even went so far as to wrap the thumb tacks I have on my board.&nbsp; Like I said impressive!&nbsp; 

Here are some images if their work.
