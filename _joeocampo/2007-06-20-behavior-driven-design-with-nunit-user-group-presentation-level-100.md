I recently gave a presentation on <A href="http://behaviour-driven.org/" target="_blank">Behavior Driven Design</A> at the <A href="http://alamocoders.net/" target="_blank">AlamoCoders</A>&nbsp;user group here in <A href="http://www.sanantoniocvb.com/" target="_blank">San Antonio</A>.


  


Given the hour constraint I had and the level 100 rating of the presentation, I was pressed to deliver the absolute essentials to get someone up and running with BDD.


  


One of the more challenging aspects of presenting an entry level BDD presentation is the fact that you have to assume that some people have no exposure to any XUnit type development.&nbsp; The founding principles of TDD (Red, Green, Refactor) must be reiterated before diving into BDD.&nbsp; Once we got passed just what TDD is, the transition to BDD went much more smoothly then I had ever hoped.
