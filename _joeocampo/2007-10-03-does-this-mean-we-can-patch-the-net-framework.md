In an interesting move <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft opened portions of the .Net Framework source code</a> to the development community.&nbsp; You will be able to seamlessly debug into the lower innards of the framework provided you have Visual Studio 2008 installed.

I wonder does this mean that the community can now submit patches against the framework?&nbsp; If they do this will be an awesome move as the framework becomes centrally managed but community owned.

What are your thoughts?
