 <img height="157" src="http://www.comicstatues.com/images/attfightpilot2.jpg" width="151" align="right" /> <img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20071114/scary_helmet.jpg" align="right" />I know this post isn&#8217;t tech related but the geek in me and my former Air Force persona, couldn&#8217;t help but share this.

Apparently this is the <a href="http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9817743-1.html?tag=nefd.only" target="_blank">fighter pilot helmet</a> of the future.&nbsp; It has the ability to give the pilot a field of view over any control surface in the cock pit.&nbsp; Meaning it can see through walls.&nbsp; Pretty impressive but I don&#8217;t know how comfortable I would be with relying on a computer to give me ALL of my visual input.&nbsp; Imagined if it blue screened in mid flight.&nbsp; ðŸ™‚
