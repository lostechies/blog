  Recent events in my professional life have placed me in an Agile evangelistic position that can help permeate the adoption of Agile development throughout my companies global presence.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am really excited about this opportunity but at the same time apprehensive.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have spent the last 4 years learning and refining my understanding of many of the Agile development methodologies.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know of its shortcomings and I know of its many strengths, which leads me to my quandary.

>   “The many flavors of Agile development, while powerful are very sensitive to some degree.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Adoption of these processes and practices require cultural changes from management all the way down to development and testing.<span>&nbsp; </span>The failure at any one of these points can lead to catastrophic break down in the alleged implemented Agile methodology that leaves adopters with a rather unsettling perspective of Agile all together.”

  In order to deal with simply having organizations give up, I was thinking of this evolutionary scale for Enterprise Agile adoption.<span>&nbsp; </span>I will refer to these evolutionary tracts as Generations.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is not an attempt to rate Agile maturity as some organization may exist fine in Gen 1 for a period of time and have great success.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is merely my perception on the possibilities of growth in Agile adoption to a certain state of development nirvana.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Do you hear the flowers singing…)<span>&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: wingdings"><span>J</span></span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>(If there is already a term for this out there, please let me know.<span>&nbsp; </span>)
