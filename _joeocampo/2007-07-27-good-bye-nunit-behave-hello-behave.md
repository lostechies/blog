Most of you who read my blog know that I have been working on NUnit.Behave which was meant to mirror the functionality of <a href="http://dannorth.net/2007/06/introducing-rbehave" target="_blank">rbehave</a> in .Net.&nbsp; My <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/06/28/introducing-nunit-behave-or-insert-what-ever-other-catchy-name.aspx" target="_blank">initial spike</a> was a success but it required that you inherit from an base <a href="http://www.nunit.org/" target="_blank">NUnit</a> Test Fixture.&nbsp; Even I wouldn&#8217;t use it!&nbsp; So I spent some time decoupling it from NUnit into it&#8217;s own framework.&nbsp; At the same time my idea caught on and <a href="http://grabbagoft.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jimmy Bogard</a> decided to do the same thing.&nbsp; Well to make a long story short we have been collaborating on the differences between our two frameworks over the last week&nbsp;and have decided to go with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BehaveSharp" target="_blank">Behave#.</a>&nbsp; I love OSS, where else could this be possible!

We will be publishing a Vision Statement and Road Map over the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; So far I have been able to sell the idea to two business analyst in our organization but I am reluctant to call this a success since it has not been adopted by the entire team.&nbsp; For a look at how we intend <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/BehaveSharp" target="_blank">Behave#</a> to be utilized please see <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/07/15/more-bdd-xbehave-madness.aspx" target="_blank">my previous post</a>.
