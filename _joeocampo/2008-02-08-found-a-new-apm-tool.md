Out browsing some mailing list today and came across this really nice Agile Project Management tool, <a href="http://www.acunote.com/promo" target="_blank">Acunote</a>.

They did a really nice job, reminds me of <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/" target="_blank">BaseCamp</a>. It supports SVN, Code Inspection on check in and best of all it is free for a team of 5 developers. It also can import the list of bugs from **<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/" target="_blank">Bugzilla</a>**, **<a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/" target="_blank">Mantis</a>**, **<a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/" target="_blank">Trac</a>** and **<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/" target="_blank">JIRA</a>**.

Let me put this out there that I haven&#8217;t used this product on a project yet.&nbsp; I am just letting you know my initial impression.&nbsp; Anyone else used it yet?
