Now a year later and the climate has changed.&nbsp; Lets see, now I can use a MacBook as my primary OS, install Fusion and run Linux and Windows seamlessly as a virtual OS.&nbsp; So in one machine I can develop and target 3 specific platforms.&nbsp; 


  


If I want to develop in Java and test my build on 3 different OS&#8217;s not a problem I have the machine to do it.&nbsp; If I want to develop a Microsoft SilverLight project&nbsp;and insure that it works on Windows, Macs and Linux not a problem I have a Mac.&nbsp; Developing a web site well &#8230; I don&#8217;t have a case for this one.


  


Quality and performance of the OS aside.&nbsp; From a practicality stand point why wouldn&#8217;t I invest in buying a Mac ? It just doesn&#8217;t make sense.


  


What are your thoughts?&nbsp; Are you ready to wear a turtleneck.&nbsp; I already love coffee shops, so I am half way their.&nbsp; ðŸ™‚
