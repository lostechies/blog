I was talking to a peer of mine Tim Quinn, who I have spent the last year mentoring.&nbsp; I have to say he surprised me, when one of our analyst argued about Paired Programming, Tim came up with this phrase:

> &#8220;If you have to move a couch you get two people, if you have to move a chair you get one.&nbsp; The assumption with most people is that software simply consist of moving chairs, where in acutallity it is an entire household.&#8221;

A tear ran down my cheek.&nbsp; This phrase compliments a post I just [here](/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/09/12/complexity-based-programming.aspx).&nbsp;
