I am proud to announce that [Sharon Cichelli](/blogs/sharoncichelli/default.aspx) has graciously agreed to join LosTechies!&nbsp; We are all looking forward to her perspective and insights into software development.&nbsp; Sharon is an active member of the Austin .NET users community.&nbsp; Her passion for software is equally balanced by her passion to see the bigger picture.

&nbsp;

Welcome Sharon!
