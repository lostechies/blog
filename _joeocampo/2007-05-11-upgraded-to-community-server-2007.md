</p> 

For those that may have not noticed I upgraded my site to <a href="http://communityserver.org/" target="_blank">Community Server 2007</a> with the help of my fellow Los Techie, <a href="https://lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/default.aspx" target="_blank">Jason Meridth</a>. Thanks Jason! 

I will be posting to <a href="http://www.agilejoe.com/" target="_blank">AgileJoe</a> and mirroring through <a href="https://lostechies.com/" target="_blank">Los Techies</a>. It makes things a lot easier for me since I do not have to maintain separate blogs. 

&nbsp; 

All of my original blog entries can still be found <a href="https://lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/default.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> on Los Techies. 

Cheers!
