George Dinwiddie announces the <a href="http://biblio.gdinwiddie.com/biblio/FrontPage" target="_blank">Agile Bibliography Wiki</a> to track readings on the subject of agile, particularly those that are useful to back up a point, or which are useful references, and invites the community to help fill out the reading list.
