A couple of people have asked me how we track our work for our iterations. We basically use a somewhat simple [information radiator](http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?InformationRadiator). 

Information radiators serve to quickly give everyone on the project team a quick indication on what needs to be done, what is being worked on, and what has been done. 

Information radiators can be as a simple as a few cards on a cork board to huge 54&rdquo; plasma displays. It&rsquo;s up your team to determine what works best. 

Here is a pic of our radiator: 

[<img style="border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px" alt="Cheerleading 006" src="/blogs/joe_ocampo/WindowsLiveWriter/InformationRadiatorsMakelifevisible_E7BD/Cheerleading%20006_thumb.jpg" border="0" height="325" width="432" />](/blogs/joe_ocampo/WindowsLiveWriter/InformationRadiatorsMakelifevisible_E7BD/Cheerleading%20006.jpg) 

As you can see the board is broken up into several columns: 

  * **Back Log**: Contains the prioritized backlog from top to bottom.
  * **Working**: Contains the stories that are being worked on along with their associated task (the blue cards) 
      * When a task is completed it moves t the Completed Tasks column
      * The little colored magnets are the developer&rsquo;s initials. I can come into the lab at anytime and quickly see who is working on what. When the developers complete a task they place their initials on the board and go on to the next task or story.
      * By utilizing a white board with index cards allows the team to quickly annotate important information and reestablish task priority quickly.
  * **Completed Task**: Well, it lists all the completed task
  * **Analyst Review**: Once all task have been completed for a Story the task bundled with the Story are moved over to the Analyst Review column to await smoke testing sign off with the developers.
  * **Ready For SIT**: Once a story is moved here indicates that this story is ready to be included in the next build to the SIT environment.
  * **Deployed to SIT**: The build coordinator will move the story to &ldquo;Deployed to SIT&rdquo; once the build is complete.

If you wanted to do this with your team here is a supply list: 

  * 3&#215;5 Assorted Color Index Cards (Task Cards): The more the better
  * 3&#215;5 Hot Pink Index Cards: Hopefully you only need one pack of 100 since these cards are used only for high priority issues or risks!
  * 4&#215;6 Index Cards (Story Cards)
  * [Magnetic Clips](http://www.officemax.com/omax/catalog/sku.jsp?skuId=20201997&searchString=magnetic+clips&productId=ARS23303): I recommend around 72
  * 1/8&rdquo; Chart Tape
  * &frac14;&rdquo; Chart Tape
  * Dry Erase Markers
  * 8&#8242; x 4&#8242;, Magnetic White Board
