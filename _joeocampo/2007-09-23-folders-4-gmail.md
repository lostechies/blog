I have officially given up on Internet Explorer as my preferred browser and now exclusively use [FireFox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/)!

Since moving over to FireFox I have discovered the wonderful world of AddOns that FireFox has to offer.&nbsp; If you are an avid user of [GMail](https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=mail&passive=true&rm=false&continue=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F%3Fui%3Dhtml%26zy%3Dl&ltmpl=default&ltmplcache=2) you will love the [Better GMail addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4866).&nbsp; It is basically a superset of some awesome [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748) scripts that make GMail a little more streamlined if you can believe that.

One of the features that Better GMail adds is a folder structure for your labels that I have been craving for quiet sometime.&nbsp; The difficult part and the inspiration for this post are that you wont find any documentation on how to enable it.&nbsp; If you follow this [link](http://www.arend-von-reinersdorff.com/folders4gmail/) it should make things much easier.
