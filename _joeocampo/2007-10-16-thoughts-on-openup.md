I have been reading up on the The Eclipse Process Framework (EPF).&nbsp; In particular the OpenUP Agile Methodology.

I found it funny that when I looked at the process documentation is resembled closely Scott Amblers [Agile Unified Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Unified_Process)&nbsp;that I had used as source of inspiration for outlining some of the concepts&nbsp;in our department.&nbsp; Then to find out that Scott was a principle contributor to this process didn&#8217;t surprise me at all.

Some of you who read my blog on a regular basis know that I have been struggling with setting guidance and direction for an agile&nbsp;enterprise adoption strategy. My dilemma has been focused on the contextual nature of our business model.&nbsp; For some lines of businesses it does fit and for others it doesn&#8217;t.&nbsp; When dealing with enterprise entities, the&nbsp;enormity of the situation comes into view very quickly.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really easy to inspire 50 people to the beat of one drum,&nbsp;it&#8217;s another to inspire 10,000.&nbsp; 

I hate to say this but when you are dealing with that hundreds or thousands of&nbsp;developers more structure must exist, then simply perceived philosophical propaganda.&nbsp; Some of you are going to read that last statement and overlook the fact that I placed &#8220;perceived&#8221; in there.&nbsp; Telling a group of this magnitude that working software is the measurement of business incentive does not necessarily motivate executive leadership to adopt these Agile processes.&nbsp; Development Groups and PMO&#8217;s quickly want to see process flows, control points, sign offs etc.&nbsp; So how do you balance the best of both world.

I am going to share with you how I am approaching it.&nbsp; 

OpenUP, AUP etc. all try to introduce bureaucracy around the Agile principles and values.&nbsp; This is a direct reaction to what the industry has been clamoring for over the last couple of years.&nbsp; &#8220;We need more structure around Agile before we adopt it corporately.&#8221;&nbsp; My&nbsp;issues with these attempts at introducing structure around Agile are in that they have introduced&nbsp;process that&nbsp;promote structure at the cost of collaboration and interaction.&nbsp; The fact that the word &#8220;Change controls&#8221; appear in the documentation scares the hell out of me!

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
> Working software over comprehensive documentation  
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
> Responding to change over following a plan

The interaction of **all** stakeholders around a common goal of delivering quality working software quickly is the strength of Agile.&nbsp; Anything that starts to interfere with these collaboration channels slowly degrades the Agile values.&nbsp; Caution and care must be take in insuring that these values are nurtured and constantly asserted on every step through any proclaimed Agile&nbsp;process.

Big Bang Agile processes provide a template that is intended to guide the team through the&nbsp;communication channels and facilitate workflow through the release.&nbsp; BUT they can easily be turned into a traditional water fall process quickly by individuals that do not understand the Manifesto and simply look at Agile as just another process ladder.

From a high level I want to propose a toolbox of Agile practices.&nbsp; The toolbox will outline various processes 

&nbsp;

So my question is what are your thoughts on OpenUP and AUP?
