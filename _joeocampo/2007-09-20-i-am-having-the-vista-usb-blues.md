OK it has been three days now and Vista still cannot recognize ANY of my USB drives!&nbsp; I have installed the latest [cumulative update](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb%3Ben-us%3B936003) from the KB articles and ran through the steps [here](http://forums.logitech.com/logitech/board/message?board.id=bluetooth&message.id=4357) to recover the metabase for the drivers.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this issue?

I am afraid I am going to have to reinstall the OS.&nbsp; 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
