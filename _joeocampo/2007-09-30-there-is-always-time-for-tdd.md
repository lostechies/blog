I just finished reading Dean Wamplers post on <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/09/29/why-you-have-time-for-tdd-but-may-not-know-it-yet" target="_blank">Why you have time for TDD (but may not know it yet&#8230;)</a>.&nbsp; He brings up excellent&#8217;s points that Agilist struggle with when trying to convey to a client on why they need TDD and how they can justify spending the time to do it.&nbsp; A must read.
