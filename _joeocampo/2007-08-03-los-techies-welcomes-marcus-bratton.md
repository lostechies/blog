I like to welcome <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/marcus_bratton/" target="_blank">Marcus Bratton</a> to the Los Techies blogging community!&nbsp; 

I have had (coughing) the pleasure of working with Marcus in the past.&nbsp; He is quick witted and loves to code.&nbsp; In fact he was one of the people who inspired the name Los Techies a few years back (see I said it Marcus).&nbsp; ðŸ™‚ Well needless to say he is a great developer and I am curious to see how his thoughts will poor out into his blog.

&nbsp;

Welcome Marcus!
