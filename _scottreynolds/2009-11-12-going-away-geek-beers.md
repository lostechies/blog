Most of you have heard by now that I am leaving Florida for the concrete pastures of New York City.

I&#8217;d like to have a get-together of some of the Florida community guys (and gals) Monday, Nov 16, in Ocala at 7pm until we decide to leave.

It&#8217;s truly been a pleasure working with this community over the last few years, and I will miss you guys. So..come on out and buy me a beer! ðŸ˜‰

Location: [O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s Alley](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=omalley%27s+alley+ocala&fb=1&gl=us&hq=omalley%27s+alley&hnear=ocala&cid=6839249953853431108)

My phone is 352.209.0943 drop me a line if you get lost of want to confirm you&#8217;re coming. So far looks like a real good group will be there, including Cory Foy, Sean Chambers, Scott Densmore, and Will Green, the amazing [Cat Schwamm](http://www.catschwamm.com) as well as members of my team. Hope to see you Monday!
