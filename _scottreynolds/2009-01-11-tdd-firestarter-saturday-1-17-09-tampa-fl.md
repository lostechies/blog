This coming Saturaday, January 17, [Sean Chambers](http://schambers.lostechies.com) and I, in conjunction with Microsoft, will be hosting a day-long set of workshops centered around testing. Admission is free, so come prepared to spend the day getting intimate with testing!

The day will begin with a deep-dive code-oriented beginner&#8217;s course to TDD (with a context/specification slant) continuing after lunch with a look at more advanced testing topics, including mocking, database integration testing, and testing WPF applications. Along with Sean and I, [Cory Foy](http://www.cornetdesign.com), [Rob Eisenberg](http://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_eisenberg), and [Chris Bennage](http://devlicio.us/blogs/christopher_bennage/archive/2009/01/07/tdd-firestarter-in-tampa.aspx) will be presenting.

Whether novice or advanced, you are sure to find plenty of value in the day&#8217;s sessions, so go [here to register](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032397083&culture=en-US) and we will see you in Tampa on Saturday!
