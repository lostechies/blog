Brief pause to correct and address a couple of things.

In my post [Quit Living in the Past &#8211; Practices Evolve](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/scottcreynolds/archive/2009/10/02/quit-living-in-the-past-practices-evolve.aspx) I used an analogy about hand washing in hospitals. It was later brought to my attention that Uncle Bob used this analogy (though not in exactly the depth that I did) on both a Hanselminutes Podcast episode and in a blog post a few years ago. I can honestly say I hadn&#8217;t listened to the podcast, and I may or may not have read the blog post, who knows? I did reply in my comments that it&#8217;s quite possible that this analogy was floating around out there due to Uncle Bob or others, or I had seen it in passing on twitter, or picked it up in a blog somewhere, and that is why it occurred to me to use it. So, officially, my apologies to anyone who thinks I have stolen this analogy without attributing the source. It was unintentional at worst, and I hope you&#8217;ll give me the benefit of the doubt on this one.

In my post [Well-constructed != Over-architected](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/scottcreynolds/archive/2009/10/01/well-constructed-over-architected.aspx), I opened with a story about a dog house. An anonymous commenter (since removed) accused me of stealing this one from Steve McConnell and pointed me to [this](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000283.html) CodingHorror post.

1) I&#8217;ve never read the book Rapid Development. b) I don&#8217;t read CodingHorror, and if I had this post is over 4 years old. iii) it isn&#8217;t even the same analogy. Get over it.

People wonder why sometimes I might treat some comments, particularly from those I don&#8217;t know, as trolls. Frankly, it&#8217;s because of crap like this. Analogies are analogies, and we shouldn&#8217;t be expected to see if anyone has ever used a similar analogy _ever_ before putting one online. In the case of the handwashing one, I realize that it&#8217;s awful similar and so like I said, my apologies for not attributing. It was an awareness thing. In the dog house case, well, give me a break. If you can&#8217;t add to the conversation, don&#8217;t post a comment on something so frivolous. And if you feel like you must point out something like this (and feel free, please, if it&#8217;s valid, as is the handwashing analogy case) then don&#8217;t be a dick about it, and even if you must be a jerk, at least have the courage to use your name.
