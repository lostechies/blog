As [Joe so eloquently stated](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2008/09/03/lostechies-welcomes-scott-c-reynolds.aspx), I&#8217;ve joined the LosTechies blogging community after just over 4 years blogging freestyle.

I&#8217;ve been watching this community grow and one thing that remains consistent is the quality of information and conversation put forth here, and I&#8217;m proud to join in and contribute to that. This community features several guys that I count among my friends, and several others for whom I have the utmost respect. When [Sean](/blogs/sean_chambers/default.aspx) extended the invitation, I was excited to join a group of bloggers who are every bit as passionate about the art and craft of software development as I am.

I&#8217;ve rolled over my feedburner feed to this site, so my existing reader will still see these posts, and to those of you subscribing to the main LosTechies feed, well, I&#8217;m sorry, but you get me now too ðŸ™‚

Thanks for having me guys!
