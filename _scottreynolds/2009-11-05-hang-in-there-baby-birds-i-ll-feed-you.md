Quick housekeeping note &#8211; How We Do Things series is not cancelled, I haven&#8217;t given up on it or run out of steam, it will still press forward.

Trying to get a lot wrapped up both at home and at work in preparation for my move to New York, so I lapsed a bit, but I will be back on it soon.
