It is my pleasure to announce Scott Densmore as the newest Los Techie. Scott is a reformed Blue Badge with work in P&P and CodePlex in his credits, and, more importantly, brings some credibility to the Florida wing of LT which was being held back by Sean and I. He also represents phase 2 of my master plan to turn this place into Los Scotts.

You can find his LosTechies blog [here](/blogs/scottdensmore/default.aspx), and if you are subscribed to the main feed you will see his posts come through as well.

Welcome aboard Scott!
