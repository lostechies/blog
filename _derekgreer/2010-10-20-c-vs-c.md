In the course of doing some reading on Scala and Clojure, I stumbled upon an interesting article by [Mogens Heller Grabe](http://twitter.com/mookid8000) entitled [C# vs. Clojure vs. Ruby & Scala](http://mookid.dk/oncode/archives/950).&#160; In the article, Mogens provides a C# solution to a word frequency counting exercise, originally [demonstrated](http://blogs.sourceallies.com/2009/12/word-counts-example-in-ruby-and-scala/) in Ruby & Scala, and later in [other languages](http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2009/12/clojure-vs-ruby-scala-transient-newsgroups.html) in attempt to showcase how each measures up.

The problem takes an [archive](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/20newsgroups/20newsgroups.html) of newsgroup articles and creates one file containing a list of all unique words with their occurrence count sorted by word and another sorted by occurrence.

Here is Mogens’ C# solution:

<pre class="brush:csharp; gutter:false; wrap-lines:false; tab-size:2;">class Program
	{
		static void Main()
		{
			const string dir = @"c:temp20_newsgroups";
			Stopwatch stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
			var regex = new Regex(@"w+", RegexOptions.Compiled);

			var list = (from filename in Directory.GetFiles(dir, "*.*", SearchOption.AllDirectories)
						from match in regex.Matches(File.ReadAllText(filename).ToLower()).Cast&lt;Match&gt;()
						let word = match.Value
						group word by word
						into aggregate
						select new
								   {
									   Word = aggregate.Key,
									   Count = aggregate.Count(),
									   Text = string.Format("{0}t{1}", aggregate.Key, aggregate.Count())
								   })
				.ToList();

			File.WriteAllLines(@"words-by-count.txt", list.OrderBy(c =&gt; c.Count).Select(c =&gt; c.Text).ToArray());
			File.WriteAllLines(@"words-by-word.txt", list.OrderBy(c =&gt; c.Word).Select(c =&gt; c.Text).ToArray());

			Console.WriteLine("Elapsed: {0:0.0} seconds", stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds);
		}
	}
</pre>

&#160;

While my lack of familiarity with the languages used in the other examples made it a little more difficult to appreciate their strengths, I felt the C# example provided by Mogens was fairly concise and intuitive by comparison.&#160; Nevertheless, I couldn’t help wondering if I might be able to improve it in some way, so I set out to see what I could come up with.

  
Here are the results:

<pre class="brush:csharp; gutter:false; wrap-lines:false; tab-size:2;">static void Solution2()
		{
			var regex = new Regex(@"W+", RegexOptions.Compiled);
			var d = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();

			Directory.GetFiles(dir, "*.*", SearchOption.AllDirectories)
				.ForEach(file =&gt; regex.Split(File.ReadAllText(file).ToLower())
									 .ForEach(s =&gt; d&#091;s&#093; = 1 + (d.ContainsKey(s) ? d&#091;s&#093; : 0)));

			File.WriteAllLines(@"words-by-count2.txt", d.OrderBy(p =&gt; p.Value).Select(p =&gt; string.Format("{0}t{1}", p.Key, p.Value)));
			File.WriteAllLines(@"words-by-word2.txt", d.OrderBy(p =&gt; p.Key).Select(p =&gt; string.Format("{0}t{1}", p.Key, p.Value)));
		}</pre>

&#160;

The primary differences in this example are the use of a Dictionary to accumulate the frequency count rather than grouping, and the use of the Regex.Split rather than Regex.Match to avoid the need of casting the resulting collection.&#160; Based on my measurements, this approach is approximately 36% faster on average than the first solution and is a bit more concise.

  
Overall, I don’t think this example has a varied enough problem domain to really compare the strengths of different languages as some have done, but I found it a fun exercise to see how I might improve the original C# version nonetheless.
