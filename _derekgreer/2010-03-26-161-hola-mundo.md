I&#8217;m excited and honored to have been invited to join Los Techies!

A bit about me &#8211; I&#8217;m a software developer currently working in the beautiful Nashville Tennessee area and aspire toward software craftsmanship.&nbsp; My professional career has been a journey from Unix C & shell-scripting to Unix C-CGI with a tad bit of C++ to Java and most recently to .Net development in C#.

I look forward to being able to contribute to the content here at Los Techies, but until I have some posts of substance, you can peruse my previous articles over at <http://aspiringcraftsman.com>.

Stay tuned &#8230;
