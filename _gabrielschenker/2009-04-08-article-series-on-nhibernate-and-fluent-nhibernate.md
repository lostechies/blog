I have been invited to write a series of articles on [NHibernate](http://www.nhforge.org) and [Fluent NHibernate](http://code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate/) on [http://dotnetslackers.com](http://dotnetslackers.com "http://dotnetslackers.com").

The first part of this series has just been published. I invite you to read it [here](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/ado_net/Your-very-first-NHibernate-application-Part-1.aspx).

In this series I start from grounds up and will explain to the readers how easy it has become to write an **NHibernate** based application since **Fluent NHibernate** is available. Iâ€™ll explain the explicit mapping with the fluent syntax as well as the auto-mapping that **Fluent NH** offers.
