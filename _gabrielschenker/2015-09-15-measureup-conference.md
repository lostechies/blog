I am excited to speak at the upcoming [MeasureUP](http://measureup.io/) conference here in Austin TX on September 26th 2015. The conference is only 10 days away and it is pretty much free (we charge a very low admission fee which includes a free T-Shirt and food). A lot of well know speakers will present many interesting topics in and around **delivering high quality mission critical software**. The conference has two parallel tracks. The talks are representing the perspective of Â development, DevOps and business respectively. Thus, no matter what role you occupy in your company there is a topic just for you.

Personally I will be presenting two topics, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The first one is about [CQRS, DDD and Event Sourcing](http://measureup2015.azurewebsites.net/cqrs-ddd-event-sourcing/) whilst the second one talks about the [necessary transformation](http://measureup2015.azurewebsites.net/reshaping-the-company-continuous-deployment-and-culture-change/) a company has to go through while embracing the concept of continuous delivery or continuous deployment.

I hope I will see you there!
