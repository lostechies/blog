In my last two posts ([here](https://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2015/05/26/event-sourcing-revisited/ "Event sourcing revisited") and [here](https://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2015/06/06/event-sourcing-applied-the-aggregate/ "Event Sourcing applied – the Aggregate")) I am talking about Event Sourcing.

Now I am very pleased to announce that on Saturday June 20th I will be leading a [free workshop](http://www.meetup.com/Clear-Measure-Workshops/events/222897184/) about Event Sourcing. Yes, the workshop is absolutely free and snacks and lunch will be provided at no cost. The workshop will be held in the same building where [my company](http://www.clear-measure.com/)&#8216;s office is located here in Austin TX. But if you don&#8217;t live in or near Austin, don&#8217;t worry we got you covered. We will provide a zoom meeting where you can join us. Please head over to [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Clear-Measure-Workshops/events/222897184/) to register and please spread this message. More details about this series of workshops and the format can be found [here](http://www.clear-measure.com/free-clear-measure-workshops/).

Our plan is to have the participants work in small groups of 2 to 4 people on a given problem. The goal is to have you be active most of the time, thus this is NOT a presentation. After a quick introduction into the topic I and some of my coworkers will simply be around to assist and guide you in your team work whenever you have questions.

The last two workshops on [CQRS](https://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2015/04/25/cqrs-workshop-retrospective/ "CQRS Workshop – Retrospective") and [DDD](http://www.meetup.com/Clear-Measure-Workshops/events/221920364/) have been a huge success. We are looking forward to meet a lot of the participants again and hopefully also welcome a lot of new people.

Based on our experience from previous workshops about CQRS and DDD in April and May I want to slightly change the way how the workshop will happen. We will present a sample business problem for which a solution has to be designed . The exercise will be presented in a way that the participants can easy follow a red line without getting lost and at the same time concentrate on the core topic of the workshop which is Event Sourcing.

We will be using Visual Studio and C# to implement a solution and use GetEventStore as our store for the events as well as MongoDB and Elastic Search for our read models.
