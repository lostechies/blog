Yesterday I had the pleasure to lead a [workshop](http://www.meetup.com/developer-springboard/events/228535653/) about [Event Sourcing](https://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2015/05/26/event-sourcing-revisited/ "Event sourcing revisited") (ES). It was organized by my special friend [Andy Siemer](https://lostechies.com/andrewsiemer/) who always does an amazing job in organizing events of any size. We also had the pleasure to have the &#8220;father of ES&#8221; [Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung) talking to us on Zoom. His company develops and supports [GetEventStore](https://geteventstore.com/) which at this time is one of the best performing, highly available and scalable implementations of an event store.

For this workshop I have prepared a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gnschenker/EventSourcing) with some documentation and sample code. The sample code is in .NET and node JS. Also included in the repository are my [slides](https://github.com/gnschenker/EventSourcing/tree/master/doc) I used during the workshop.

If you are interested in more details about event sourcing then please also refer to the following posts, where I explain all aspects of ES in detail
