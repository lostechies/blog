But I didn’t sleep… no, I was busily creating a video series about “Building an Application with Angular JS” consisting of 9 sections with in total 41 videos. This was a fantastic new adventure for me and I learned a lot since I have never done any Podcast or Video before. I am very excited about the result.

My publisher [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) made the series available today. Please find it here

Now finally I will have time to continue writing blog posts about my favorite subject Angular and also Node JS. Stay tuned and please let me know what you think about the videos.
