Yesterday a new excellent book about **NHibernate** has been published by [www.packtpub.com](http://www.packtpub.com). (Disclosure: I have been a reviewer thus consider that when reading this post)

The book is called “**NHibernate 3.0 Cookbook**” and can be ordered [here](https://www.packtpub.com/nhibernate-3-0-cookbook/book). There is even a discount available; please refer to [this](http://fabiomaulo.blogspot.com/2010/10/nhibernate-30-cookbook.html) post of Fabio Maulo.

This is so far the best and most complete book I ever held in my hands. It covers **NHibernate 3.0** and thus is really up to date. The author has done a tremendous job in covering all the important aspects of interest when implementing business relevant solutions. The book is very focused and gives a step by step introduction into all the necessary details to get a solution up an running. No space is wasted for (potentially) unimportant details.

One of the things I like most is that the book/the author does not have a data centric view but is more domain focused.
