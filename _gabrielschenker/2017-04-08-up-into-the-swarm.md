Last Thursday evening I had the opportunity to give a presentation at the Docker Meetup in Austin TX about how to containerize a Node JS application and deploy it into a Docker Swarm. I also demonstrated techniques that can be used to reduce friction in the development process when using containers.

The meeting was recorded but unfortunately sound only is available after approximately 16 minutes. You might want to just scroll forward to this point.
