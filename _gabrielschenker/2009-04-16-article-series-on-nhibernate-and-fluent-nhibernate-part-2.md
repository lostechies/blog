Today the second part of my series on NHibernate and Fluent NHibernate went live. You can read it [here](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/ado_net/Your-very-first-NHibernate-application-Part-2.aspx).

### Summary 

In part 2 of the article series I have continued to implement the remaining part of the domain which I had introduced in the [first part](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/ado_net/Your-very-first-NHibernate-application-Part-1.aspx). I discuss the mapping of various forms of relations between different entities. For all mappings I have presented the code needed to verify the mappings. 

In part 3 of the article series I’ll show how one can further refactor and improve the mapping of the domain model. I’ll then discuss the usage of conventions and finally show how one can use the auto-mapping capabilities of **Fluent NHibernate** to completely avoid the explicit mapping of entities.
