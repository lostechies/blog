In a series of posts I would like to introduce our Fluent Silverlight framework and discuss the important concepts behind it and describe some implementation details. This post will be updated continuously as I am adding new posts to the series

## Table of content

The first three articles where I introduced the new framework as well as an article of [Ray Houston](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/rhouston/default.aspx) about the technique we use for our view models to implement the **INotifyPropertyChanged** interface
