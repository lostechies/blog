I’m pleased to be invited to speak/present at the [ADNUG](http://adnug.org/) meeting on Monday July 9th, 2012 at 6pm. The topic of my presentation will be [CQRS](http://cqrsguide.com/) and [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) with a special focus on how we do it at [TOPAZ Technologies LLC](http://www.topazti.com/).

> #### Abstract
> 
> In our company we were looking for a way to radically simplify the way we implement our enterprise software. We wanted to get rid of accidental complexity introduced by using complex and expensive middleware and server software like RDBMS. In this talk I’ll give an overview on how we use CQRS and event sourcing and how we were able to significantly improve our velocity and at the same time concentrate more on the business requirements and less on technical implementation details.

See you there!
