<p style="clear: both">
  At the <a href="http://tddfirestarter.lostechies.com/">TDDFireStarter</a> event this weekend in Tampa I met some really cool kids that I have talked with on Twitter, yet never really met in real life. These guys are really fun, smart and love community. They even asked me to join their little corner of the interwebs :D. I would like to than <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/sean_chambers/">Sean</a> and <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/scottcreynolds/">Scott</a> as well as all the other <a href="http://www.lostechies.com">LosTechies</a> that allowed me to ride with the cool kids.
