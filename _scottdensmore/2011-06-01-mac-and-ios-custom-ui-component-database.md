After yesterdays post on my Dev Toolbox on the Mac I realized I left out a couple of good things:

  * [Custom UI Component Database for iOS and Mac OS X](http://cocoacontrols.com/)
  * [Windows Azure Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft-dpe/watoolkitios-lib) 

I have been playing around with the Windows Azure Toolkit and it is quite cool. Cloud + Phone is fun!
