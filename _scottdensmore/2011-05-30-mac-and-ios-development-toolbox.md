I have been building for the Mac and iOS for the last couple of years and the list of tools I have ben using has been growing (and shrinking).  There is a great development community around the Mac / iOS. There are a lot of other tools / code out there that you can read to learn more.

**Tools**

  * [Xcode 4](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/whats-new.html) &#8211; Xcode 4 is a big jump from 3. I have to admit Visual Studio is great, yet I like the simple yet complete IDE.  You can get this in the AppStore or from the developer site.
  * [CodePilot](http://www.codepilot.cc/) &#8211; a good tool for searching through source code and files.
  * [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) &#8211; this is a new IDE to the market from JetBrains. It has a lot of great potential with the backing of JetBrains.
  * [Accessorizer](http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html) &#8211; This is a must have tool for XDE. It helps to enforce coding styles and reduces typing. You can pick this up in the AppStore.
  * [TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) &#8211; This is what I use to do Continuous Integration builds for my projects.
  * [AppScanner](http://www.chimpstudios.com/appscanner/) &#8211; Find what might get you rejected before submitting your app. It will look for private API usage.
  * [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/) &#8211; A great tool to use for designing just about anything. I use it to do most of my iPhone / iPad layouts. Helps make doing the UI much easier. 
  * [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/) &#8211; Probably the best diff tool for the Mac. Great UI and integration with just about everything. 
  * [Versions](http://www.versionsapp.com/) &#8211; A great tool for use with Subversion. Although I am a command line guy, I use it to watch projects I am interested in or use.
  * [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) &#8211; A great tool for use with Mercurial and Git. Again, I am a command line guy, but I use it to watch projects I am interested in or use.
  * [CSSEdit](http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/) &#8211; Do you have a love / hate relationship with CSS? This will make you forget most of the hate. 
  * [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) &#8211; The jack of all trades text editor. 
  * [XScope](http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope) &#8211; If you do a lot of web development, you will love this tool. It makes doing pixel perfect measurements a breeze on screen.
  * [HTTPScoop](http://tuffcode.com/) &#8211; A great tool for sniffing HTTP traffic.
  * [HTTP Client](http://ditchnet.org/httpclient/) &#8211; A great tool to test out those web sites to see what is going on. 
  * [SOAP Client](http://ditchnet.org/soapclient/) &#8211; I don&#8217;t use this a much anymore, but if you run across SOAP methods you have to use, good to have this tool around. I almost put this in the open source area because you can get the code for this.
  * [XML-RPC Client](http://ditchnet.org/xmlrpc/) &#8211; Yes they still exist. If you want to test out those methods&#8230; this tool is helpful.
  * [Icons](http://empoc.com/mac-os-x/icons/) &#8211; Get those icons for you Mac / iOS app with shine.
  * [Sound Stage](http://soundstageapp.com/) &#8211; After you make that great iOS app, record your demo to get those sales.

**OSS**

  * Facebook 
      * [Facebook IOS SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk) &#8211; If you want to do any Facebook integration with your app, this is the SDK for you.
      * [Three20](https://github.com/facebook/three20) &#8211; Good set of UI classes to help build your app. If you want to connect your TableView to the internet as a data source, this can help.
  * [ASIHttpRequest](http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/) &#8211; If you are doing anything network you will want to use this library. 
  * [JSON Framework](https://github.com/stig/json-framework) &#8211; Framework for creating / reading JSON objects,.
  * [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD) &#8211; If you are displaying a HUD or progress indicator and want something a little more than the activity indicator, use this.
  * [TapkuLibrary](https://github.com/devinross/tapkulibrary) &#8211; A great library that has some good reusable tools / UI code.
  * [NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger) &#8211; Track down those annoying bugs and extend NSLog.
  * [RestKIT](https://github.com/twotoasters/RestKit) &#8211; I have not used this yet but looks promising if you are doing REST calls in your application.
  * [iOS Azure Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft-dpe/watoolkitios-lib) &#8211; Good toolkit to connect easily to Windows Azure.

**Testing**

  * [OCHamcrest](https://github.com/jonreid/OCHamcrest) &#8211; Toolkit to write matchers for your tests. Replaces the asserts you normally use.
  * [OCMock](http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/software/OCMock/) &#8211; Mocking framework for your tests.
  * [Tuneup JS](https://github.com/alexvollmer/tuneup_js) &#8211; A set of extensions for the UI Automation Instruments tool.

Enjoy!
