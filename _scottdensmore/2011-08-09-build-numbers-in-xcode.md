Working on a Mac / iOS projects, I have been trying to come up with an easy way to bump versions when it goes out the door for testing or production. Mostly I have been working it out manually, yet that is now fun after the dozenth time. I  started looking around for something that would fit my [workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). I found a couple of posts that help me out.

  * [From Hacker to microISV: Tagging, Building and Releasing](http://www.cimgf.com/2009/07/06/from-hacker-to-microisv-tagging-building-and-releasing/)
  * [Revisiting git tags and building](http://www.cimgf.com/2011/02/20/revisiting-git-tags-and-building/)

After reading the two posts (especially the last one), it should be easy to follow what I am doing to bump the versions of the application. It feels natural with the gitflow technique. Download the code from the GitHub project [here](https://github.com/scottdensmore/BuildNumberTest).

Enjoy!
